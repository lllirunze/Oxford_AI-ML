Customer_1,B*rstards who take pleasure in harrasing disabled people,"As a disabled person in an empty branch, they told me to walk on crutches all around the snaked area to get to the furthest till. I complained and they said tuff, so I reported to them to the disability communities and banking ombudsman, who asked for the CCTV footage. BANK_NAME said their CCTV was not working that day! A Bank that does not have CCTV functioning. You can bet if I held them up the CCTV would be available. Sadistic S***s "
Customer_10,BANK_NAME -  dont bother as they have little regard for customers,Bad customer service in branch and not enough counters. You want that 121 service from a human not a machine Also steer clear of BANK_NAME Finance biggest pack of Con merchants I have ever had the misfortune to come across
Customer_100, I visited the Bognor Regis BANK_NAME … ," I visited the Bognor Regis BANK_NAME Branch today to pay in a sum of cash (£920) into my wifes account. As she works from home and isn't often able to get out I quite often take her debit card and pay into her account using one of the machines. This morning the machine didnt seem to be working properly. I tried twice and both times the money was returned with a receipt saying the transacton had been cancelled. I walked away from the machine with the intention of paying in at the counter. After a few minutes I noticed I hadn't received my wifes card back from the machine. I was unaware if the card had been taken or left in the machine. I can imagine during this time a few other customers had used the machine so I panicked a little unsure of whether the card had been swallowed or possibly removed by a different customer. There was a member of customer service staff, Linda Murray, assisting customers so when she had finished I told her the situation. I was still a little panicked at the time but when I was less than halfway through explaining the situation she told me extremely bluntly I couldn't get the card back because it was in my wifes name. I completely understand this and think that is obviously the correct procedure in stopping fraud etc. but the customer service from then on I thought was awful. She was unaware if the machine had taken the card or if it had been removed by a customer but very bluntly said the card will be cancelled"". Without taking my wifes (or my name) how could she cancel the card if it hadn't been taken by the machine ?. She gave me no advice on what I should do from that point"
Customer_101, Abysmal business service ," Abysmal business service. If you are a business then don't use them. We have been trying to process an international payment recall and we keep chasing them for the money - they just fob us off with excuses. On top of that all of a sudden today our account has been suspended for no apparent reason - they won't contact the MD of the company, I can't lodge a complaint because in order to lodge a complaint you have to go into the branch itself apparently (very convenient) and they are totally unhelpful quite frankly. They are the ones who have created the problem and we are supposed to run around after they make a mistake. "
Customer_102, Disgusting company ," I have company account with BANK_NAME and got a business loan with them when I was very new in business. I desperately needed the loan to expand my company. I was really naive and didn't realise how much I would have to pay back. The loan was for 25k and is guaranteed by me and my business partner. I have been paying the loan off for 3 years and 4 months at 670 pound per month. In total I have paid back 26,800 but still have 14k left to pay. I take responsibility but I didn't think BANK_NAME's would offer such disgusting deals. Shameful and they won't let me change the deal even though I have never missed or made a late payment. "
Customer_103, Rubbish service , Rubbish service. Been with BANK_NAME for over 10 years. Nothing ever went wrong and now suddenly my account has been blocked. Rang and asked for an explanation was told to visit my branch. Went there and was told to contact a number contacted that number and was told to wait to 2 weeks maximum as it was an internal investigation. So waited. Now 4th week and no one can tell me anything. Such a rubbish service. Closing my account down and taking this to social media. 
Customer_104, Poor treatment by bereavement centre. , Contacted bank regarding account my late sister had with them. Branch unable to trace account. The spoke to bereavement centre. Wrote letters and emails with no reply. Now  4 months later all i know that the account was closed and money transferred to an account in my wifes name. Wouldnt supply details of account number or value because of data protection!! So glad i dont have an account with them! 
Customer_105, Unsatisfactory customer service , Unsatisfactory customer service. Very slow responses to online banking messages (much slower than advised response times) and absolutely no desire to resolve my problem. 
Customer_106, Complete knobheads ," Complete knobheads, lost 130 pounds on international payment. When calling the phone, in the end was told to go to a branch, when gone there told me to call the nr. Thankfully didn't send any more at the time but basically they didn't care and kept sending me somewhere else. "
Customer_107, Be prepared to waste a lot of your time.. ," I've been to the Uxbridge branch to open a joint account with 2 cards attached and to opening a EUR account. I sat there with the personal banker for about an hour and he assured me that everything is done and that they'll get it done in 3-4 working days. After one week of waiting with no updates, I started calling them and I've been told that none of those requests gone through and that I need to go back to the branch and ask for the same things again. Tried getting a new appointment now and they only have slots available mid December for Saturdays. This is unacceptable from a bank this size. Go to MetroBank and get the card on the spot with no hustle. Shame! "
Customer_108, BANK_NAME business account ," BANK_NAME business account. Best decision I've made in a Long time.The app is also awesome and easy to use, "
Customer_109, the telephone customer service is … ," the telephone customer service is always shocking, you feel like your talking to a robot. last 3 times ive called ive had a different woman all the same, they act like they couldnt care lol. i asked if i could have a £400 overdraft added on, was asked some questions then she asked me if i wanted to add on a travel pack and if i did my first £200 of the overdraft is free so i said yes but i had to ask as she didnt actually say at any point if i was entitled to an overdraft , she also said the travel pack wasnt going on and that she would call me back once it was on, which she did not do and as far as im aware you would surely know the systems well etc before being trained on overdrafts so its just awful awful customer service as usual from BANK_NAME. "
Customer_11,BANK_NAME bank in chadwell heath essex,"BANK_NAME bank in chadwell heath essex is rubbish.

Customer_110, Fair play BANK_NAME you confused me , Fair play BANK_NAME you confused me. I applied for a loan of 5k over 3 years to pay £170odd a month i got declined.I then applied for a 0% credit card over 36 months and got accepted. Makes no sence to me but if your happy. Good to find a bank that knows what its doing. 
Customer_111, Very poor service.  Unacceptable wait times. ," I've been a BANK_NAME customer for over 25 years, however, recently I've had cause to call them up on certain errors they have made on my account.  It's fair to say that the service from the team in the Indian call centres is amongst some of the worst I've experienced with any company.  The call wait times are ridiculously long, the staff, when you do get through, are not at all well versed with which departments deal with each query, they give out incorrect numbers and leave you pulling your hair out.  I messaged them through FB Messenger in the hope that I might get a better response time, however, the entire conversation took a total of 12 hours to deal with and each time I put out a simple 'hello is anyone there' a different representative messaged me back.  I tried the 'live chat' option through my banking app, only to be given another crock.  here I am today now 27 minutes in to a call where I have yet to speak to a real person.!!  Simply unacceptable.  I have now closed my bank account and going with First Direct who really do know customer service!  Avoid these morons at BANK_NAME like the plague. "
Customer_112, worst team ever with terrible and … , worst team ever with terrible and annoying automation system and absolutely no control of processes am currently switching to a digital first bank because of the terrible service 
Customer_113, Good bank but issues with telephone banking staff. ," In the two years, I have banked with BANK_NAME, I have not experienced any serious problems. When I switched from First Direct via the switching facility, there were no problems. Since then, I have not had any issues; the branch staff in St Anne's Square in Manchester have always been helpful and polite. The online banking app provided is excellent so much so, I very rarely need to resolve any problems in a branch or on the telephone.If I do have a criticism, it does relate to the ability of the telephone banking staff to resolve problems. Much of this I'm afraid is due to the ability or lack of to understand the English language. Whilst such staff are capable of handling routine issues, many have difficulty in being able to converse adequately when the problem becomes complex. Too often, you have to deal with an individual whom you know is reading from a pre prepared script rather than responding to what you actually say . However,  this happens very rarely but it is an issue BANK_NAME need to address. "
Customer_114, BANK_NAME Smartinvestor , Like others I find the Smartinvestor site incomprehensibly bad. BANK_NAME Stockbrokers site (which it supposedly replaced in late August) was problematic but at least adequate.My 2 month experience with Smartinvestor should be fodder for an FCA enquiry and finding of incompetence!1. Next to no customization of investment windows available2. No access to read or retrieve documents supposedly circulated to investors e.g. end August letter to all investors3. No statements available for self-download (plus a promise of twice a year fixed statements maybe sometime)4. Up to 45 minute waits on average for their preferred communications modes - webchat or telephone call (Customer service staff when you reach them are helpful and sympathetic but not able or authorised to do anything about the mess)5. Yo need to Google feedback form because they wont link it to their site directly 
Customer_115, Just rubbish bank , Just rubbish bank 
Customer_116, They are ok ," The switch over to BANK_NAME went ok and originally I liked the app. However, new app update means I can't add new payees. Trip to the cash machine to set it up and now told to wait 10 days so still waiting to see if this has improved. Also I've tried to contact them to discuss issues and get passed around to different call handlers. Eventually to be cut off and they don't call you back. Also now getting cold called stating I've had my card declined so they want to sell me products. I advised them I haven't had my card declined or there must be suspicious activity on my account. I asked them to investigate it but he refused and said I had to ring BANK_NAME or go to branch. Basically he was cold calling with no evidence of my card being declined. "
Customer_117, Complaints ignored ," I would give BANK_NAME Smart Investor zero stars if that was possible.  I have been a customer for many, many years - with Charles Schwab before it became BANK_NAME Stockbrokers.  It has been one long unmitigated disaster since accounts were transferred to Smart Investor in August.  I currently have an issue where they have failed to act on a corporate issue which they said, on their website, they would action in mid October.  I should have had a substantial amount of cash in my account shortly afterwards. When nothing arrived I queried with them on 26 October and basically got fobbed off.  Made a formal complaint on 7 November and have basically had no response other than one call where the caller seemed to have no idea of the facts of my complaint.  Was told it might take 8 weeks to investigate!There is little to investigate - Smart Investor should have received some proceeds for some shares and I should have the cash in my account.  This is not rocket science. They are basically useless.Advice to anyone thinking of opening an account with them - don't.  My other half is trying to switch their account to iWeb and has been told it might take 3 months or more due to a backlog of people trying to do the same.  What a surprise.  They should be paying massive compensation as they charge high enough fees for what is a pathetic service. "
Customer_118, I had an account with BANK_NAME several … ," I had an account with BANK_NAME several years ago which they closed without giving me a reason. I recently opened another account online, really easy I thought. I have phoned BANK_NAME today regarding a query and the advisor called me Mrs...I asked him why he had called me Mrs and he said that was what it said on the screen. I informed him that I would have applied as Ms and I expected Ms to be on all my information. He then called me by my previous surname from before 2008, so obviously my new account has been linked to the account BANK_NAME closed years ago. I asked him to change the Mrs to Ms and he said he was unable to, I would have to go into my local branch and change it there. He told me the branch closed at 6pm. I checked on the internet and informed him that the branch closed at 4.30pm and I could not go to the branch because it was not open outside my working hours and this was why I had originally opened the account over the internet. I asked him again to change the title and he informed me that for the security of my account I would have to write to them to request the change to my new title. I informed him it was not a new title, it was the title I put on the application form and it was their error. I also said that they were not concerned about the security of my account when they put the wrong information on it. Their attention to detail certainly does not inspire confidence. He told me to phone the branch direct and perhaps they would do it over the phone. I phoned the number on the local branch information, which of course took me straight back to the indian call centre!! I told the second advisor that I wanted the bank's error sorted out or I would be closing my account. He refused to change my title and I said I would be closing my account, he then said I would have to write to them to close my account, I said no, I'll just wait for you to close it when you realise it isn't being used!!

However, in the last few weeks their service has been exceptional. I have had to contact BANK_NAME via phone 3 times in the last 2 weeks and every time my calls were answered within 10 seconds, the service was very professional, the agents were very well spoken, knowledgeable and personable.  Well done BANK_NAME!! "
Customer_122, I have several bank accounts for business. Service is very poor in my opinion. ," I have several bank accounts for my businesses with BANK_NAME, the service has been very poor in my opinion. I was recently abroad in Spain and had a huge amount of trouble accessing my online banking which I was told I needed to then visit a local branch to resolve. I had already explained I was abroad for 4 weeks and this was not possible. Even though I had gone through extended security I was told they could not help. Eventually, after 3.5 hours on the phone in total, I managed to get a resolution, but scripted call centre staff are the main and are unable to help from my experience.I will be moving all of my accounts as soon as I can.

"
Customer_126, Avoid at all cost , Avoid at all cost!  I had been with BANK_NAME for 5 years until recently I had suspicious activity in my account which they thought was fraud even though they didn’t even tell me that to begin with not only that I had just under £400 in my account so they decided to block my account so even I couldn’t access it.  They did an investigation which took about 6 weeks and eventually closed my account which I was aware of.  Now they won’t give me back the money which they say is in holding unless I can prove where the money has come from even though I shouldn’t have to.Thanks BANK_NAME for being the worst bank ever.

I can't fault HSBC so far, helped me get set up with a line of credit. "
Customer_13,Awful,Awful. Everything about the experience in having a mortgage from BANK_NAME is terrible.

I have lost money as a result and undue stress. As of today, in November, I am waiting resolution.The last mess was yesterday when I found that £100,000 was directed to an incorrect account 10 days ago! Then BANK_NAME had asked me to resolve it with the new provider. HOW CAN I FIND A CLASS ACTION LAW FIRM? "
Customer_131, Avoid for Business Banking! ," Have banked with BANK_NAME for 20 years personally. Started using their business banking service in the last few years, and although the branch service is excellent, the telephone banking support is handled from a call centre somewhere in Asia, where the accent is so thick that it's hard to understand them. I've tried having a Direct Debit transaction refunded using the 24 hour guaranteed refund, but it's now 3 weeks later, having made more than 4 x 40 minute phone calls and filed a complaint, I'm still non the wiser. Reassured each time that a refund will be made and a complaints handler will call me, but still nothing. Hopeless and will be contacting the Financial Ombudsman. "
Customer_132, Full of knowledge but need a more friendly approach! ," Visited Rugby store as I needed help with access to online banking app. Staff in store were full of knowledge and did help me, but they could be more polite and friendly, instead of just firing information at me about all the services they provide.

A key transaction that was asked about by the Ombudsman was denied by them. This transaction was pivotal to the Ombudsman case. They sent a list of transactions to the ombudsman that omitted this transaction which would have appeared in the middle of the transaction-list they sent.I then sent the ombudsman an official BANK_NAME statement clearly showing the transaction was made. Now based upon this another case is being opened against BANK_NAME because they have not complied with the original ombudsman ruling.What a bunch of pirates !Listen to their singing... can you hear them ...'Yo ho ho and a bunch of ppi.Yo ho ho we adore financial crime'Avoid at all cost.

Customer_136, Absolutely disgusting service ," Absolutely disgusting service. I’m 37 weeks pregnant and have been waiting for our mortgage offer for the last 9 weeks. They made a mistake with our application and we keep getting told we’ll hear from them in 48 hours, 48 hours pass and we hear nothing. Again, we’ll hear in 48 hours, again, 48 hours pass and we hear nothing. Again, we’ll hear in 48 hours and still, absolutely nothing. I’ve also filled a complaint which they aim to respond to in 48 hours but it MAY take up to 5 working days. Obviously 48 hours has passed and we’ve heard nothing. The customer service help line is based abroad so it’s very difficult to have a successful conversation with them as unfortunately they don’t understand me fully and I can’t understand them. Asking someone to repeat themselves 4 times can come across rude so o gave up after that. In my complaint I explained that I’m experiencing panic attack’s and severe anxiety with each passing day as I currently have nowhere to live together with my boyfriend as I can’t move in with him and he can’t move in with me, so unless some kind of miracle, I won’t be able to take my first baby home to my own place to raise with its father. I’ve never been so disappointed and let down in my life. If I could give them no stars then I would. "

That was on August 28. iWeb have confirmed in writing that it took six approaches from them before BANK_NAME agreed the transfer, on the last day of October. And each account will probably be frozen for three months while the transfers go through. So I shall be unable to access my life-savings for the best part of five months! It is a national scandal.

Customer_140, Just poor all round ," I was a customer of Barcays for around 10 years and received repeatedly bad service. It took several months for them to process a name change and years to correct my title. They also confirmed that they had changed my graduate account back into a student account after I went back to universty as a mature student, yet kept charging overdraft fees at the graduate account rate. The queues in branches were never acceptable - the main Liverpool branch tended to have half of the counters closed despite queues of 15+ persons, not to mention the suspicious refusal to answer any questions about ethical investment policies. It has now been years since I closed the account, and I have yet to receive confirmation of that too. Would not recommend. "
Customer_141, Avoid!!!!! BANK_NAME Bank at all costs ," I have been banking with BANK_NAME for over 15 years now and the worst ever service I've received from them when I was trying to make a payment for my council Tax which had it's last date past but when trying to make the BANK_NAME blocked the payment which resulted in council taking further action for extra charge for costs incurred. then, later on, I had an emergency to go abroad for the same day i was trying to book my flight BANK_NAME blocked my card and online banking too when calling them they don't care at all about anything instead asking me for evidence trying to call me a liar and asking me to visit the branch the very next day when I am not even able to visit it due to not being in the country, I will definitely sue the bank and will be looking into closing my account if they don't compensate me for all the problem they've caused.

Every advertised number connects through to India, who cannot and will not put you through to a UK person. Even their London HQ lie to you and transfer you to India, who put you on hold and lie to you. Going to transfer all money to another bank, disgraceful how as a British person living in the UK I cannot speak to anyone from BANK_NAME in the UK apart from HQ who can't help you anyway. Get your money out quick before they become Northern Rock version 2. Banking at its ugliest very worst. "
Customer_144, Avoid Smart Investor ," BANK_NAME Stockbrokers were excellent , but Smart investor is shockingly bad.If you  Lock your account out, it takes almost 2 weeks for them to reset the password. Customer service takes about 15 mins to answer  on a good day after which you are passed around to numerous departments . Late dividends.access difficulties. website dropout .New system with no mobile app. loss of  power of attourney over partners account and a steadfast refusal to discuss the account , are just a few frustrations . Finally switched and now half the funds have transferred to my new provider and the other half are stuck in BANK_NAME , this has happened on both accounts more than 5 weeks after the first funds transferred to the new vendor. It looks like the competent  Stockbroker business has been transferred to an incompetent retail Bank.....avoid at all costs "
Customer_145, I'm a victim of fraud.  Why won't you help! , I was recently the victim of fraud. A company called Redan Marketing debited 28.67 out of my account. They had my debit card number yet I had not used my card online for services or purchases for some time. Also I would have no need for any type of marketing services. I looked into the company and the only mention is on companies house. No telephone number or website. No email. All there is is an address and company director. The director opened 6 companies on the same day with the same information.I went to BANK_NAME with this information yet they still couldn't do anything. The payment is still pending now 3 working days later. I think that it's strange that you report a fraud to a bank expecting them to stop the payment and refund the money but no! They won't do anything until the company either completes the transaction or the money bounces. Meanwhile I am out of pocket. I think the lack of support from BANK_NAME was/is poor. To give BANK_NAME credit they did bring this to my attention in the first place as the transaction was done at 02:47am. I have changed my card but I have been told that any company who has used your card or set up a continuous card payment can ask the bank for my new card number WHICH THE BANK HAVE TO GIVE! So I could have this happen again.

Constant mistakes, no customer service, a definite attitude that I didn't really matter.I had to complain to the financial ombudsman service about BANK_NAME three times and each time FOS found in my favour because BANK_NAME tried to dismiss my complaints and failed to keep their promises. Probably the worst company I have ever been a customer of in any respect. "
Customer_157, Disorganised systems , Locked out of on line banking. One week later with 2 branch visits plus all requested ID they can't reinstate me. No one seems to be able to communicate effectively. Really poor customer service. Lots of apologies but no one capable of fixing the issue. Upside is there are many other banks out there who are better organised.

Customer_159, A complete total shambles - now a dumbed-down platform for the amateur ," The whole process of moving people to the new platform has been a shambles which has resulted in 30,000 (out of 200,000) customers moving £1.3bn of assets out of BANK_NAME, mostly to Hargreaves Lansdown (Daily Telegraph). Right from the start it has caused a lot of hassle. I had to write a letter(!) saying what my nominated bank account was and setting up a new mandate. I didn't know (I pay in from several) and they wouldn't tell me. They could have just given me the last 4 digits as a clue, which wouldn't have compromised security. I complained but just got auto replies. In the end I worked it out by a roundabout route. A week ago I got another regular email saying they were taking my complaint seriously. I tried to email back but got an autoreply saying they 'no longer communicate by email'! I am not joking - there is NO email ANYWHERE where you can send detailed correspondence or complaints, and the chat function (if/when available) would not give you a record unless you take screen shots. They do say you can write a letter to them though!!!I had to spend so much time writing letters, sending in new mandates by post etc. Fortunately I was away at the time of launch so missed out on further misery as others suffered trying to log on. I eventually guessed that the 'memorable word' was a password you had to set up. Why didn't they just say 'create password' instead of making me wrack my brains trying to remember? I have managed to get in but it has less functionality than the old one. I would be tempted to move but it would be 6 to 12 weeks out of the market when anything could happen.Do BANK_NAME realise how seriously they have messed up? They have lost so much business and more will follow. If you are thinking of setting up a trading account with BANK_NAME Stockbrokers my advice is - don't!I was happyish with the old system for years. "
Customer_16,shocking,"I and a friend visited the Sheffield store to sort out some bank statements ect. The customer service in which we received was absolutely horrendous!! The staff was absolutely shocking, one member of staff stunk of BO, another was just pointless. One particular member of staff looked and sounded high. The way he addressed customers even outselvea was a discrace, to think these people are trusted to look after our money. I have certainly seen more enfusiasm in a pencil. Will be closing my account"

The times on hold have now come down to about 15 minutes though the recorded message says 5 minutes !! I was forced to move an international stock holding from my ISA account. I set up a new ISA account ready for the transfer at the beginning of August but it still has not been done despite telephoning nearly every day. In one conversation I was told that it was a good thing I had persisted as my holding was eventually found in an account which neither I nor they knew existed.  I felt hopeful at this point but still nothing has happened and the transfer has not been made. I would like to transfer my entire portfolio but dread to think what will happen after this experience. BANK_NAME have behave in a wholly irresposible way. Avoid them. "

Customer_170, Appalling service. , terrible experience of this bank. After my father passes away I went into a branch to remove my father's name from the joint account he had with my mother. They took her name off the account in error and froze the account. I pointed out the error. It took days to get the account open after they simply failed to do anything once they realised their mistake. They still sent out a cheque book in my father's name. After yet another visit to the bank they then managed to mess the address of the account up and still haven't rectified it. I've tried to register a POA with them and after over 2 weeks its still not been done. They say they haven't received it. I went into the bank and gave them the documents and application so struggling to see how they couldn't have received it! Hideous service. 
Customer_171, If BT or British Gas was a bank it'd be BANK_NAME - spectacularly awful customer service ," I'm an accidental BANK_NAME customer courtesy of an old mortgage from Woolwich before BANK_NAME took them over.  I've just wasted two weeks on the sort of thing that my normal bank - First Direct - would have done instantly.  All I'm trying to do is transfer funds from a flexible lending facility attached to my overdraft to my current account at another bank to then make payments for some building work.  Two weeks later, I'm still wasting my time talking to people in India.  First I went into a branch with all relevant ID and was told they'd send my a bank card for the account and then I could do it myself.  A few days later, the card arrived and I discovered I also needed an internet PIN.  Five later, the PIN arrived only for me to discover I needed an electronic gadget that took a week to arrive.  I tried organising the transfer by telephone only to be told I'd need a different telephone PIN.  Finally, the gadget arrived and I arranged the transfer online.  Then nothing happened - because after spending two weeks jumping through security hoops they stopped it anyway because it was unusual for the account - not that they told me that - I had to ring them up for an explanation.  I've now just rung their people in India to check everything's OK with the transfer this time round and wasted 20 minutes on somebody who couldn't understand the question.  If BANK_NAME doesn't want to do high-street banking any more it should just be honest about it and pull out.  I struggle to believe that BANK_NAME actually wants retail business based on this sort of customer service - and I'm a high earner.  They couldn't pay me enough to have anything to do with them in any normal circumstances.  Go elsewhere - preferably to a customer service orientated bank with UK call centres - and save yourself a lot of grief. "

I said today, he said I will order it for the 5th or 6th, I asked why I couldn't have it today and he tried to explain it has to come through the post and would take 2 to 3 days, I again asked for it to be posted today I he said he would order it for the 6th due to having to come by post. Going around in circles so I just said post it. How can BANK_NAME be meeting their legal requirements if their personnel cannot read the legal statements or speak English! Pleased I am leaving them.

Customer_173," Awful, rude attitude "," Saturday 30th September 2017 @ 0930 approx - BANK_NAME Bank, Banbury, Oxfordshire.I called in to BANK_NAME Bank with the intention of updating my address for my BANK_NAMEcards earlier today.Upon entering the bank I noticed only two staff - one young man roaming around in a suit, and a woman behind a help desk counter. I approached the woman at the desk.As soon as we established eye contact I knew she didn't want to see me. She appeared, quite clearly, in a bad mood and not wanting to be at work.I asked her if she could update my address. She replied that she could do - in a grumpy manner - clearly indicating that I was disturbing her for whatever reason. She asked for my card and when I removed my BANK_NAMEcsrd Credit Card from my wallet, she took great delight in informing me that she couldn't update my address details because I was presenting a Credit Card and not a Debit Card.She then barked out her orders that I will have to phone a number on the back of my card and speak to BANK_NAMEcard in order to update my address.Fair enough ! I don't have any problem with procedure. However, I did find it very disappointing to be made feel like a worthless hindrance by a person who (supposedly) is meant to be a face of BANK_NAME. I don't enjoy being barked at by grumpy, disrespectful staff who go out of their way to make certain that you perceive yourself as little more than an annoyance.BANK_NAME let themselves down very badly this morning - through the bad manners of a miserable member of staff who did nothing more than repel customers. I won't be visiting Banbury BANK_NAME anymore because there is plenty of competition who do treat customers correctly. "

Customer_175, BANK_NAME turned my life around ," Years ago I had a serious motorway accident which put me out of work and led to me getting my ccj which has left me in in financial disparities since. BANK_NAME were the only ones who would give me a bank account. Everyone else would look at my score and write me off straight away without even considering that i had never missed a payment before the accident. If it wasn't for BANK_NAME giving me my account I would not be fitting kitchens for b&q and turning over minimum of 80,000 per year. So once my ccj has gone and credit score back up. I shall be getting my mortgage, car finance, van finance and anything else I need on finance from them as they were the only ones there for me when I needed it the most.

By the end of the day BANK_NAME had contacted me to say my card details had been cloned and they would monitor my account for any fraudulent activity. They also said they would send me a new debit card and cancel the old one. A new card arrived within 1 day, and to my surprise it was a personlised card with the same photo of my dog that I had on my other card. I am very impressed that they sent me a new personlised one without me asking for it, as well as picked up the card cloning so quickly. Thanks BANK_NAME! "

I received an international payment and by default the senders bank made an error and transferred the funds twice. I received a confirmation from BANK_NAME stating I received two payments which I accepted and spent.   Without informing myself BANK_NAME removed funds from my savings account. As a premiere customer I made a complaint as I believe in this situation I should of been informed. The person dealing with my complaint had the audacity to search me on LinkedIn rather than dealing with my complaint. Which I believe is below the belt and breaches my data protection rights.   I made a complaint twice to BANK_NAME and once I was told that I should chase up the bank who made an error. The person searching me up on social media I would be compensated for £100.00 if I remain silent.   I escalated this complaint once again and it was referred to Clarie Pennington who said due to the work load BANK_NAME has we cannot notify all customers if we withdraw money. Secondly the person can look me up on LinkedIn as it is a public domain and we have a mutual connection.   This is just beyond dishonesty, I sent a screenshot to the BANK_NAME team showing how the person has looked me up and I received a notification. Not sure where my data has been used and why I was looked up on LinkedIn. BANK_NAME needs to review their process in place as this is in Breach of my privacy.

Customer_182, Smart Investor -I am using the free transfer out. ," I don't bank with BANK_NAME but have had ISA accounts with them for many years.  Over the years there have been some minor problems but their staff  were always helpful and did their best to solve them.  Their sharedealing site was in general efficient, reasonably priced  and worked well.The  smart investor ISA is more expensive (for my ISA) but I can't really review it because I have never been able to log onto it.  the site is confusing and seems to be aimed at customers that bank with BANK_NAME.  They give you a long customer ID number of about 12 digits, another equally long one for telephone.  Unfortunately when you remove them from the separate letters they are sent in it is no longer possible to see which one is for telephones and which is for on line.  OK perhaps removing them one by one and making a note  to say which is which - Oh no sorry do not write these numbers down! In addition there are  pass cards.  I managed to get my self locked out - only three attempts.  ring up - huge de;lays in the first weeks slightly better now.  The telephone staff are polite and as helpful as can be.  Your old accounts have vanished and you can not access via the old password but they will put new pass codes in the post to you and you will have them within three days.  Oh that was 12 days ago they haven't arrived.   I am able to deal on the account by telephone which now is usually answered in less than five minutes, the staff as always polite and helpful in placing telephone orders and only charging the online rates.   Of course I am not able to access my portfolio and all the information I need from it.  The old system was not perfect and could do with improvement but this is a more expensive and useless system.  I will shortly be an ex BANK_NAME customer.  There are much cheaper ISA providers out there  with working internet interfaces. "

Four months of paying $300 I've only my loan still says I owe $9,500.

Ive been a BANK_NAME customer for twenty years, and i didntwant credit, just a debit card, but whatever! So I went in to my local branch. I waited 45 minutes in branch and apparently only one person could help me with this simple task and this is why two people went ahead of me whilst waiting.   I had to leave for school pick up and said that this was ridiculous and I would just close my account and go somewhere else- Could I book an appointment to do so. Apparently only one person can access the diary as well, so I couldn' t do it there and then, but they would call back before the end of the day.   Needless to say no phone call. So second call to customer services, can I book an appointment- no appointments until mid-march!!! Id have to travel to another branch. The next branch, Welwyn Village, he said didntexist but blatantly does as I have been there. So suggests I go back in to Welwyn Garden branch to close it down with no appointment and sit and wait!    Really? Absolutely ludicrous service and no wonder I am going to BANK_NAME, where all of this was completed over the phone, no problems in about five minutes flat!"

Does anyone know why they have made it quite so difficult?  I see by some of the reviews below that at least some lucky people have been able to log in.  Can you close these types of accounts in branch does anyone know?  Or can you transfer your holdings to another broker.  Excuse my French, but bloody hell BANK_NAME.

I phoned customer services who advised that there is no second card listed against this account and that we need to go back to the bank with 2 forms of ID and do it all again.  We have already spent time over 2 Saturdays trying to sort this out to no avail.  We are being told to go back again, one to make an appointment to see a consultant, the second to re-do the application.  A huge waste of our time and we will not be doing this.

Where by the way, you have to book an appointment if you need to talk through anything. But don't even bother trying to call the branch to make an appointment, you have to call another country to do that!! They got the appointment for me at the wrong branch! So I trudge in, with my mother in her wheelchair on public transport to be told we hadn't got an appointment there at all!-despite booking one!Had they offered me the phone app for banking (on Power of Attorney already set up) I wouldn't be in all this stressful situation in the first place! Getting her account set up online was like jumping through hoops but I still cant use it to scan cheques and have to, again, trundle into the main town. I called the live chat line and they asked my name and 6 minutes later hadn't uttered another word! I gave up!! What is going on?!! Is it not enough that I gave you all my money for 35 years, as well as you having many friends' and relatives money because of my recommendation some years ago? Couldn't you at least pretend to care?The app is great, but people who care for others and have their account set up adjoining their own so they can manage both need to ba able to have both on the app! Come on guys! "
Customer_2,Changes for the worse all round,"Recent changes to the online banking site have added hours onto processing epayments each month, not that it was great to start with.  Changes to paying in cheques in the local branch have added on hours off wasted staff time.  Nothing to be happy about really."
Customer_20,Smart Investor True review is no stars,"Smart Investor: True review is no stars.  More expensive, cannot hold certain shares I have. I am still waiting for transfer to complete despite requesting August 2018.  Have wasted days worth of hours on the phone."
Customer_200, Completely incompetent ," Awful service. Opened a business account weeks ago. Still have not received pass codes etc to transfer money from the account.No one helps, most of them barely even speak English. I wish I never opened an account with them. Avoid!! "
Customer_201, Incompetent ," 20 years as a customer - Took several weeks to set up a euro business account after being mis-sold a 'premium' business account. Now it seems I cannot make transfers out of my new business account. A week has passed and the only response I get is Sorry to hear you are still having problems regarding on-line banking. Would you please call our online banking team on 0345 600 2323 for further assistance?"". I will be moving my money and business elsewhere"
Customer_202, What have you done BANK_NAME? ," What have you done BANK_NAME?I've been with BANK_NAME Stockbrokers for over 20 years and loved their platform. What have they done with Smartinvestor platform? It is a throw back to the 90's. I used their email link and it took me to a page resembling early days Internet web pages - BANK_NAME, who ever designed this you need to sack and ask for your money back. You had one of THE best platforms in the UK and now you've got one of the worst. Add to this their customer service. I ran at 09:25am this morning and took the call back service - having been told I was 10 minutes away from a call. A clueless person from BANK_NAME returned the call at 12:30pm - only to tell me he couldnt answer my questions and put me into the system again - it took 15 minutes for a human to answer but again, he could not help me with my questions so he put me onto another department who had a automated message saying too busy and suggested a call back in 20 mins. I took this option again - this was at 1pm. It is now 5pm and I've had no call back call from BANK_NAME. I emailed the Client Relations Dept at 1pm hoping that would prompt a call - but I can only assume they must be swamped dealing with a mass of complaints. It really is a shambles. It is so sad to see a company who positively promote usage of IT on the TV then deliver such a sub standard and back ward looking platform.  Time to look at some of the challenger platforms. "
Customer_203, Don't waste your time with the … , Don't waste your time with the telephone banking system.  10 minutes on hold to speak to someone with a very low grasp of the English language.  Problem still unresolved.  30 minutes of my life I will never get back. 
Customer_204," Smart Investor,what a joke. "," Smart Investor,what a joke. appears to have been cobbled together by a dyslexic four year old.Why turn such a good investing platform that BANK_NAME had into such a disaster. difficuty logging in.Halfway through process a Pingit page pops up and you have to start again.Site shuts down constantly.Cant log on at all now and have to wait for new code to be sent to me.Told to use telephone to buy/sell which would be fine if anyone answered the phone. probably queue of disgruntled investors trying to get help. i have had enough and as soon as I can log on will be selling all of my investments and moving elsewhere,certainly wont trust them to move my investment to another sharebroker.

Customer_205, I did not receive any details re new … ," I did not receive any details re new sign on and passcode.Called the contact number several times 40 minute wait to speak to someone. Finally got through and was assured new log in details would be sent, nearly a week later nothing has arrived. Tried to use website to retrieve details but you just go round and round the navigation. What a load of  rubbish , if I ever get to sign on I am selling everything and closing my account. Foolishly I actually own shares in BANK_NAME which not surprisingly have bombed. On the I. T. side I have been a I. T. consultant for more than 30 years. "
Customer_206," BANK_NAME Smart Investor""? you are joking! """," I've just been moved over to BANK_NAME Smart Investor"" - its new stockbroking platform"
Customer_207, A ghastly leap backwards. , For customers coming from BANK_NAME stockbrokers this is a ghastly leap backwards.Many features existing in the old system have gone or degradedThe worst for me is the inability to display a decent number of investments on the screen at once. I detect the influence of the mobile phone where scrolling is acceptable.Just to make it clear I do not (and will not in future)  use a mobile phone for investments. 
Customer_208, SMART INVESTOR  - A truely awful step ," The smart investor platform is just not doing it for me.It may be a personal choice but I  the BANK_NAME stockbroker services were far more intuitive and effective.I can no longer view my portfolio assets and quickly review news and analysis tools. As a small investor I regularly monitor, place and edit trade base on the market. I can't do this on the new site it just not fit for purpose for small investors.The BANK_NAME stockbroker site was a far superior system and I have great service from them.This new system is a unfit, glossy mess.I will be looking for a new provider as the smart investor poses too many issue with being in control of my own investments. I am well aware that investment can incur loses, as an individual I can accept this risk, but I don't think I can accept the risks of posed by poorly structured and retrograde IT system, which I will be paying for. Truly Awful step BANK_NAME "
Customer_209, Poor customer service. Poor bank overall , Well to start I've been with BANK_NAME for 4 year 5 months and I've had no problems with my credit since with this bank. I first applied when I started to work offshore. I have tried several times to apply for a small loan and overdraft just to help me out with emergency cash available when either out of work or circumstances change. This time I've been out off work 9weeks due to a medical condition which needed attention before going back to work. I'm due back to work in 3weeks. I have money going in each week. I have been declined an overdraft and Im really disappointed with this bank. I have a relative with Lloyd's bank who is on lower income with bad credit ect and has an overdraft of £500 I just don't think this bank has to offer me any better than any other bank else where! 
Customer_21,A bank that treats customers like s***  and give you minimum information... Avoid like a plague,They put your account on review not giving you any brief information why and block your account for every little reason. Example tried to setup Apple Pay and they froze my account for almost a day. They customer service are least helpful.
Customer_210, BANK_NAME survey , I wonder if anyone else has had this experience. After I logged out of my so called “SmartInvestor” account a new page appeared and I was asked to fill in a BANK_NAME Online survey. As I thought this would be a good time to let them know what I thought of the new system I decided to start the survey. However after about five pages of the survey my anti-virus software (Bitdefender) came up with a red warning “This page has been block because a phishing attempt has been detected”. The advice was to leave the page which is what I did. So unfortunately I was unable to complete the survey and give feedback to BANK_NAME. If BANK_NAME wants feedback why would they have such a poorly constructed questionnaire? Is this just another example of BANK_NAME incompetence? 
Customer_211, Chronic Failure , This is chronic. Not viewable in my Firefox v. 55.3. Calendar selection of date does not work. Appears to be no history of transactions by date; where are dividends listed? Hugely unfriendly. The previous site was excellent. Analysis a big step backwards. Why the hell they didn't leave well alone god knows.Where are others moving to? How about AJ Bell? Opinions on where to go please. 
Customer_212, they have changed the way I can … ," they have changed the way I can complete share trades on their investment accounts, it takes so long to complete each trade that the prices are moving against you. Why have you gone backwards BANK_NAME, will be closing my account with them very soon!!!!! Also got a number of letters from them telling me that if I needed to contact them that the call centre will be answered from someone in uk, but when I did, it was definitely not someone in the uk and spoke English with a very strong Indian tone and he had to seek help twice in order to solve my problems.

Customer_216, Unbelievably inept switch to BANK_NAME 'Smart Investor' ," Re. the switch from BANK_NAME Stockbroker to so called 'Smart Investor' - this is as far removed from 'smart' as it can be, with a complete lack of communication about any problems. I have experienced wasted hours; trying to log in, misinformation in BANK_NAME communications, lack of access to support, either by phone, web chat or email but most of all no access to online trading for 2 days - previously I would access my portfolio 2-3 times a day.When I did eventually get through to someone, there was no unqualified apology for the complete lack of service and the problems brought about by their own doing, more a sentiment of 'well unfortunately this is what happens when we are undertaking such a large upgrade.'I will be moving to another service provider as soon as possible.On top of that, as a shareholder I have been hit twice as the share price seems to be reflecting the poor management performance! "
Customer_217, BANK_NAME Snub Investor – No access for 6 days ," What a total cock up by BANK_NAME, the transition from MarketMaster to Snub Investor means no access to SIPP+MM+ISA since 27th August.  There is no approved workaround and they have not even acknowledged there is a problem or a guaranteed date when it will be available!!!   I've logged my compensation payments for each day they fail to provide me access.   I urge everyone else to do the same.   As for the product Snub Investor, I cannot comment BECAUSE BANK_NAME CANT GIVE ME ACCESS!’  Customer service is overwhelmed and won’t admit anything.Top Tip BANK_NAME, revert back to MM and plan this properly, your CIO should be offering his resignation. "
Customer_218, I hate to quote Trump ," I hate to quote Trump, but BANK_NAME Smart Investor, is BAD, VERY BAD.Please please reinstate the old system immediately if you want to keep your customers.To get to any useful share movement information takes forever. I used to go to BANK_NAME Stockbrokers account many times during the day to assess the market, now never.The Hargreaves Lansdown site gives all the info I need in literally one click, so of course that is where I go, no need to even login. "
Customer_219, Appalling website and dreadful service ," I started off with Sharelink , moved to Schwab and hence to BANK_NAME by my reckoning over 20 years. To take a good and functioning platform and turn it into this dreadful neutered abysmal offering is outrageous.To add insult to injury the only place top access useful content is through a well hidden link to the research centre which actually appears to transfer you back to the BANK_NAME stockbrokers website. My transfer requests will go in this week. I expect problems. "
Customer_22,Worst bank and customer service in history,"I took a 20 mile trip and an hour in the branch to open two help to buy ISA accounts, we deposited money in cash.. a week later, I get a letter stating my account has been closed for no reason whatsoever. I called BANK_NAME to complain and the complaint department called me back and stated the reason was they did a review and that the bank decided they didn't want us as a customer. That was the only reason given. This is discrimination and appalling for any bank to do!! They can close your account without any reason whatsoever!!"
Customer_220, Fellow reviewers please note there is a … , Fellow reviewers please note there is a Trust Pilot listing for BANK_NAME and another for BANK_NAME Stockbrokers. Ive added my review to both so that potential customers are aware.The new Smart Investor platform is complete car crash for me as a regular share investor and trader.  Switching to IG for now. 
Customer_221, Really rubbish ," Really rubbish.  I opened a account with no problems and after that they write to me that they will close my account with no reason . This action decrease my credit score with more than 100 points from 496/700 to 359/700 . I'm really disappointed and when I asked a costumer service advisers he told me they can't do nothing.  ( spent more than one hour to get in touch with someone) . I'm not recommend this bank. They don't care about customers.  I will request a court decision for decreasing the credit score with no reason and because they been indifferent about my credit score and they decrease it with Not been my fault I will claim a compensation as bigger as I can. I'm not gonna keep any penny from this and I will donate all the money for poor kids. I will do this because i hope this company in the future will stop playing with the costumers.  I will post the update here, on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter  and Instagram to let people know who is BANK_NAME.  I will defame them in the same way that they do it to me. Liviu-Gabriel Rizescu "
Customer_222, BANK_NAME new platform A disgrace ," Clients will leave in droves over  the coming months, obviously the people in charge do not have a clue what their customer wants. A J Bell and Hargreaves Lansdowne must prepared to take on new customers "

Now your site has migrated to the above I find it appalling and it is too dumbed-down for my share-dealing purposes.  For instance, I cannot:a)   Get Broker Views"" etc up without going onto another web-page for ""Research)"

Customer_225, BANK_NAME NOT SO SMART they have shot them selves in the foot , BANK_NAME not so smart they have shot them selves in the foot againWhy have they changed a winning formula the only reason i have stayed with there market master share account for the past 20 years is because there website was brilliant and simple to use probably the best stockbroking website on the internet .The new system is pathetic i can only assume that BANK_NAME don't want to be a stockbroker any more I have lost all my history and watch lists from the old system  THIS IS TYPICAL OF BANK_NAME THEY DONT GIVE A DAM ABOUT THERE CUSTOMERS 
Customer_226, BANK_NAME at war with it's own customers !! ," I am a longstanding customer but didn't wish to move to Smart Investor as, after doing an analysis, it was significantly more expensive for myself. I am trying to move my account out of BANK_NAME stockbrokers for a while now without success, despite repeated contact efforts. I submitted a formal complaint to them on 23rd August and received back an email which stated the following.....We are sorry you’ve had cause to complain and we would like to assure you we’ll look into this thoroughly. We hope to have an answer for you as quickly as we can. If it takes longer than 20 September to investigate all your concerns"
Customer_227, I thought it was me ," I thought it was me, now I know that what I thought I couldn't find is not there!  40 minutes wait today in the queue, up from 20 mins yesterday.  Had personal account with BANK_NAME since 1964 when I left school - think it is time to move.  BANK_NAME Smart Investor is a joke.  Someone should be sacked. "
Customer_228, Heads should roll at BANK_NAME , Heads should roll at BANK_NAME. What a disaster. It's not getting any better. Any advice on who to move to? 
Customer_229, Nothing Smart about Smart Investor , The move to this service from BANK_NAME Stockbrokers was appalling. I have spent over 3 hours this week waiting for phone calls to be answered. The 'new' system is totally inadequate as a trading system. The system does not give daily price movements for your portfolio and stock news and information is hidden under a research section in a totally different screen. It is not possible to make informed investment decisions based on this system. Why did they move from the BANK_NAME Stockbrokers system? I have been a customer since Charles Schwab days but will now have to think of moving elsewhere. The final insult is that I received a letter from them today saying that my complaint from August 28th had been satisfactorily resolved and was now closed!!!! No way - Unbelievable customer service. 
Customer_23,AVOID banking with this BANK horrendous pathetic poor service,Have been a BANK_NAME customer for over 20 years and have 2 business accounts with them. From one day to the next they froze my business account with tens of thousands of pound in it. NO REASON GIVEN not in branch and not on the phone .No call of warning or explanation of what is going to happen .Bills can't be pay purchases can't be made. When I put in a complaint they called to say they are closing the complaint  and if I an not happy I should go to the FSA !!!( 8 weeks before you can even lodge a complaint ) They said it could take 10 days or more to even write out to explain . DISGUSTING. Awfully rude people . KEEP A MILLION MOLES AWAY
Customer_230, Pretty much to my amusement ," Pretty much to my amusement, everyone else here has got the same opinion as I do - Smart Investor is a bloody disaster. Over simplistic, no access to the most basic information...it's like an unfinished draft. Add that to the lack of customer support and be like exit stage left!!! "
Customer_231, BANK_NAME smartinvestor a shambles! ," Can only add my total dismay at the shambles callers 'smartinvestor'. I have been a BANK_NAME account holder for both personal and business for over 30 years and have found the mobile app and personal banking page easy to use. I have also been a BANK_NAME Stockbroker account holder for several years with a sizeable investment ISA. The move to smartinvestor is a shambles. As others have noted, the new investment pages on the site are hopeless and almost completely useless as a basis for building up a portfolio. I am having to use my investors chronicle portfolio page to find the information I need. I will give the new site a couple of moths before having to go through the horrible process of transferring all my accounts. I agree with the view that the CEO should be held to account for this shambles. "
Customer_232, The new smart investor provision is an … ," The new smart investor provision is an absolute waste of space. Sophisticated it is not. The expectation would be that as technology expands any change would be an improvement. This looks like an old style bank who has no idea what a self-execution investor needs or wants. The system is sluggish and bland - it takes far too long to make transactions and pushing a page in between buying/selling giving me information that i am not going to read is an absolute irritation. My portfolio value has been incorrect all week therefore I am having to make my own calculations at the end of the day/week.  Investors are far more savvy and knowledgeable these days and this is a huge retrograde step. I will be leaving - I am not prepared to pay more for a substandard service. Sad really as the BANK_NAME stockbroker system was far, far better. What possessed them!! "
Customer_233, The old Stockbroker system was the only … , The old Stockbroker system was the only decent thing about an otherwise pretty appalling bank - so they transfer to Smart Investor! Complete disaster haven't  heard a good thing about it - can't actually comment personally though as I still cant access it! 
Customer_234, It should be called Dumb Investor ," I managed to login to Smart Investor on the second attempt and since then I've been able to login every time.  I have to keep logging in becasue the site logs me off intermittently and takes me back to the home page.  No idea why.  And then some pages don't load and I can't go back.  So, I login again.  And so it goes on.  I did manage to place a trade but I hate the new site so much I'll not be staying with Dumb Investor - even at £6 a trade.I'm taking my SIPP to iii or AJBell, not sure which yet. "
Customer_235, While I feel that I'm one of the lucky … ," While I feel that I'm one of the lucky ones who've been able to get into the site, the platform feels infinitely inferior to the previous one and there are obvious inaccuracies that are affecting the value of my portfolio. A primary example is how the last price of one stock in my portfolio viewing page reads 176 (when the actual closing price is 230 and even when you go to buy/sell it, it reads 230), meaning that I'm not as up as I should be! The prices in the portfolio viewing are all inconsistent with the actual closing prices of the stocks. And as for getting through to speaking with someone... "
Customer_236, the other people who have reviewed this … ," the other people who have reviewed this site are lucky. They have received their log on ids.  My wife and 90 year old mother have not. My wife waited 50mins on the phone to try to sort out, only to be asked about details of her holdings........which she cannot find, because she cannot log in any more. Hard to imagine worse service. "
Customer_237, Samrt Investor is Awful ," My SIPP has been forcibly moved from BANK_NAME Stockbrokers to Smart Investor.The site has been designed by people who know nothing of the work flow"" of investors managing their portfolios"
Customer_238, If I could have rated it negative 100 I would , This is the most shocking system transfer i have ever experienced. BANK_NAME deserves to lose every single customer. The new system just doesn't have anywhere near the functionality of the old and trying to get through to customer service to get help.....3 x 50 minute calls before I could even get a response and then the agent who answers just doesn't know. Dreadful - absolutely dreadful. 
Customer_239, Do not go anywhere near BANK_NAME Smart … ," Do not go anywhere near BANK_NAME Smart Investor. It is a complete shambles, a trading platform that makes it almost impossible to trade. Many of the functions, such as Quote and Deal, do not work or take a very long time to complete. The list of problems is without end. Shockingly bad. Stay away. "
Customer_24,Totally useless - cashback is fake news,"Totally useless    cashback- is a scam, don't waste your time, effort, energy or money opening a Blue Rewards account because you just won't get your cashback   if you have already registered for blue rewards and haven't had your cashback don't bother trying to log a missing cashback - because they won't sort it out    you just get lied to and fobbed off oh and cut off and handed off.  no one seems to know how to resolve issues with the app or cashback in general"
Customer_240, utterly dreadful ," utterly dreadful. seems I am not alone - BANK_NAME Stockbrokers worked wonders, great website. Not the cheapest but worth it for the interface and access to research. This is dreadful. Maybe time to buy Hargreaves Lansdown shares? lol.(Seriously though, can anyone recommend a new broker) "
Customer_241, The Lunatics Have Taken Over ," BANK_NAME Stockbrokers have provided me with a first class service for 15 years, and I just can’t believe they’ve replaced it with something that is so utterly awful.As a BANK_NAME banking customer, I now have to log on to investments via my bank account, with all the complexities of gizmos for entry via pin sentry. I find it very tedious, and can’t see myself bothering to log in to the site unless I absolutely have to. It also means that my banking details are exposed when I’m involved with investments, sometimes in the presence of others. I’m very open about my investments to family and friends, but don’t want to share my personal banking details. I help my sons with their investments, but have no wish to intrude on their bank accounts (nor would they allow me to). Then we come to the new website with its cheesy front page of Learn, Plan, Invest (Vomit). I found the old system superb and easy to navigate – no longer. Smart Investor has turned out to be a (not very funny) joke. I tried complaining, but like others could not get through. I have emailed, but so far have received no response. I’m not going to waste any more of my time complaining to an organisation that has now quite clearly lost the plot and no longer provides customer service.  Rather, I’m going to make a progressive move of my investments elsewhere, starting with the cash balance with a view to buying all future investments on that platform, and making further cash transfers out as I sell the shares held by BANK_NAME.  My sons have indicated that they will do the same. It’ll take time, so I intend to transfer to another bank as well so that BANK_NAME are forced to give me a non-gizmo related login identity for the interim period. "
Customer_242, Smart (in whose opinion?) Investor - the worst yet ," Absolutely appalling migration and product, over 30 minutes to answer helpdesk calls, chat team have no access to Smart investor account. If BANK_NAME wanted to close this down they could have saved the IT development money and just told the users they wanted to close or sell the old BSL business as, reading other comments on the web, that is what they are effectively doing. I will take advantage of the free transfer offer and move my funds to another provider, though no doubt BANK_NAME are overwhelmed with transfer out requests "
Customer_243, Terribly disappointed , Terribly disappointed at this almost unusable website. Been a customer since 2003 and was previously happy with the product. Am actively looking at alternatives right now. 
Customer_244, BANK_NAME shambles , This new so called smart service is appalling. Why did they have to scrap the excellent platform that they had originally. Every aspect on the new one is bad from logging on to simply seeing cchanges on the day. 
Customer_245," old website perfect,new is a disaster "," the old website was perfect. the new changeover has been nothing short of a disaster. theres conflicting information on processes (procedures that didn't need pin sentry now need it), vital login information has not been sent, incomplete instructions on the website, no trade data to be found on shares, the website is too wide for a laptop, theres adverts on the middle of the screen . will be leaving BANK_NAME entirely "
Customer_246, I've been with BANK_NAME Stockbrokers … , I've been with BANK_NAME Stockbrokers since the Charles Schwab days (20 + years) and am completely dismayed. I'm off with a £1.4m portfolio. But as yet I'm not sure where! They just dont care it was a wonderful website. Why do they do it? If its not broke dont fix itThe chief ex of BANK_NAME Stockbrokers should resign for allowing such a shambles. 
Customer_247, ISA MONEY INVESTED GONE MISSING ," OMG, Smart Investor have lost my money. This is shocking. Monday 28th I spent 1.5hours on phone with Smart Investor (yes I was lucky to get through), with 2 ISAs transferred but 1 has gone missing. They put complaint in for me, but since I left with them on Monday I have heard nothing, I cannot get through and 2 more complaints via secure email and nothing 60 hours later. Spoke to my Premier account instead and they said they cannot help BUT they can see my complaints on the system which will be answered at some point. So not sure where my money is and how to go about getting it back. The new smart investor website is appalling but not concerned about that, I just want my money back so I can move to another service. BANK_NAME should be ashamed. "
Customer_248, complete chaos -- smart investor ," complete chaos.  had different letters giving different ID's, passcodes.  phoned to sort out, gave up after 57 minutes.  now locked out online, no access to accounts, no dealing.  webpages refer only to Online Banking, no mention of Smart Investor ( change of name required here ).  to get back online they ask for card details, but I am not a banking customer so have no card.Heads should roll.I shall be rolling out asap "
Customer_249, What on earth do BANK_NAME think they're … ," What on earth do BANK_NAME think they're doing ? The so-called 'Smart Investor' service must be the worst website ever written with nothing but problems since its release to former BANK_NAME Stockbrokers customers on Monday morning. Thus far, logging in has been highly problematic, the site abounds with technical problems such as links which don't work or lead nowhere, and clickable headings which don't work. Many of the useful features of BANK_NAME Stockbrokers have vanished and the overall operation of the new site is clunky at best, utterly dysfunctional at worst. It's an appalling mess.Trying to contact BANK_NAME has also proved problematic. Web chat is effectively unavailable and there are ridiculous waiting times on the telephone. There is an email contact which I found almost by accident as it doesn't appear via the 'contact us' button, but that hasn't yet produced any response either. In desperation I've emailed their CEO, Jes Staley whose personal address is  - jes.staley(at)BANK_NAME.com ; maybe a deluge of messages to him might bring about some improvement in this dire situation. "

Customer_250, BANK_NAME smart it aint !!!!!!!!!!!!! … ," Have had a SIPP with BANK_NAME Stockbrokers for 15 years. Never any problems until now. The move to smart investor is a disaster, I've been locked out of my account despite entering all the correct details. I've been trying for 2 days to get through to the helpline all to no avail. Shortest call 30 mins, longest 60 mins. A lot of the info that was on the old website eg technical analysis etc etc has disappeared. I'll be switching. "
Customer_251, Horrible customer service waiting time over 45 minutes for SmartInvestor , BANK_NAME have just moved me to Smart Investor. The customer service waiting time is HORRIBLE. I am writing this review while waiting for them to answer - it has been 45 minutes. Seriously considering moving away. 
Customer_252, What the hell have BANK_NAME's … ," What the hell have BANK_NAME's Stockbrokers done moving accounts to Smart Investor?, the previous share dealing platform was superb and then BANK_NAME's send you all the hype how Smart Investor will be better... no way there is no research or recent trade deals adding to this all my trade history on stocks I hold has disappeared... If your a Smart Investor get out now..tried calling Customer Services four times today only a forty minute wait...BANK_NAME's you have screwed up big time "
Customer_253, BANK_NAME is a very horrible bank , BANK_NAME is a very horrible bank. they just put your account under review without proper questioning. What if i am starting a business? or need it for medical treatment? all they know is to put it under review for 10 whole days with the likely hood of them permanently closing the account. I really regret it 
Customer_254, Stupid Investor is what this should be called ," Useless, it does not tell you have to trade a share. When you work out how, you now have 3 extra steps: you must select Shares from a drop down, go to a screen where you select which account you want to use even if you only have one account, then go to a screen with a risk warning which you must accept each time.The only way to contact them is by phone or web chat. Their phone line says calls cannot be answered for more than 40 minutes. Their web chat says 'Unfortunately we're busier than normal and can't help you at the moment'. This must be due to all the customers asking how this works or complaining.It takes longer to log in as you have to input your surname, a 12 digit code, a pass code and digits from a memorable word. The site usually logs off automatically every few minutes so then you have to do all this again.The site is very slow, when you go to a different screen it is often blank so you have to reload it.The previous system was not great but this is far worse.

Customer_255," BANK_NAME, not so, Smart Investor "," BANK_NAME new share and investing platform Smart Investor is awful.  The old website was at least 10 years out of date but all the new site offers is a little gloss.   It is still nowhere near competitor offerings and doesn't offer an app.  The new website is clunky and confusing, isn't intuitive to use and requires the patience of Job.  I'm also experiencing connection problems, getting logged out or frozen screens for no apparent reason.One of the most damming issues in my opinion is that at a portfolio level (i.e. ISA) change is measured over a 12 month period whilst for individual holdings it's measured from the date of purchase/investment- very confusing and there doesn't appear to be any customer choice!   Furthermore it's not possible to see daily price movements as a %.   You have no idea if your shares are going up or down at ant time unless you can remember all their prices!  I have had an opportunity to speak directly with the MD of BANK_NAME Stockbrokers about this but, not surprisingly, he leaned towards arrogance - afterall I'm only a customer what do I know? "

Customer_265, New Charges to over limit , This time its was not my fault my account when over and they used to charge £8 for over limit. Now they are charging £8 + £5 for everyday until paid.

Customer_266, Appalling service to business … , Appalling service to business customers. I tried to notify them of a change of correspondence address by phone but they told me to go to a branch.So I went to a branch and they changed my personal account correspondence address but for business they told me I had to call the helpline that had refused to deal with me in the first place. The staff were hopeless - they told me I could go to another branch 'but I would have to make an appointment.' I suggested that a change of address might not be unprecedented among their business customers. Should I close my business account and open one with another bank? You could do that

I recently requested that I convert my basic current account to a savings account with them. I was so impressed with the service at my local branch in Anglesey. The Branch Manager was able to action this request immediately - no appointment needed. The card arrived in the post two days later and all my existing funds were transferred over. When I requested that a new savings account with my primary bank, they took 5 working days to respond to me and declined my request on the basis that the information I allegedly provided them with did not match the information they already held on me - despite banking with them for the last fifteen years. They asked me to try again but I thought sod that, and decided to open an account with BANK_NAME instead. Great service so far. Very pleased with them. "

The BANK_NAME staff I spoke to were the most unhelpful I have ever dealt with. I bought the phone, outright in the end and will never use BANK_NAME again."
Customer_270, Appalling service after fraud ," Absolutely appalling experience with the fraud team - our business bank account experienced four withdrawal totalling £14600 each of which were either cash withdrawals in branch or counter transfers in branch using a fake ID. I had been in touch twice with the fraud team via telephone as, first, they had blocked my card - so I called and then unblocked it and the second time when then blocked my internet banking which they again reinstated all in the space of 4 days (Friday to Monday). Because the internet banking was suspended I didn't see the first three fraudulent transactions until they fed through to my bank feed on my accounts package which has a delay of 2 working days. The third time I called the fraud team because they'd blocked my card yet again they advised me that somebody had made a withdrawal using a fake ID yet this was not mentioned to me on either of the two previous conversations despite it having been logged on their system two days previous to my first call. The staff in the BANK_NAME branch were extremely helpful, caring and understanding and they completed the form on their system detailing each of the four fraudulent transactions which were made without a debit card - just with fake ID. They stated that they didn't understand how this could happen as they all have UV lights at every station and check signatures and ask account related questions if somebody doesn't have a card to use in the pin sentry machine in branch. Once the form was completed I was show the screen which said that the full amount would be credited back to my account that day. Today I went in to the branch to check whether the amount had been credited and to make some payments (as my card and internet banking is still suspended). It hadn't been so they called the fraud department who told me that a person in their front line team had overridden the repayment until the fraud had been investigated which could take a month. So I am left £14600 down in my account and feel as if I've been treated like a criminal. I asked why they hadn't the courtesy to call me to let me know that this had happened and they said they had written me a letter which should be with me next week! Absolutely disgusted. The manager of the Barnstaple Branch called me later to express her apologies but there's nothing they can do - you can't speak directly to the front line fraud team either - they hide behind all the other call centre and branch staff. I want to know whether they've contacted the police, and what is being done about the staff who allowed the transactions to take place. Also BANK_NAME are constantly blocking my card and asking me to verify transactions even to people I pay on a regular basis and yet they fail to spot the fact that I never go into branches in London nor do I make over the counter transfers or payments out that large apart from to HMRC - which stupidly they've declined previously due to the VAT payment being  a 'large' amount. I'm completely and utterly dumbfounded and beyond angry. I am now in the process of moving my accounts. In my opinion the fraud department have been negligent. If you think your hard earned money is safe with BANK_NAME... think again "

Customer_277, So far so good (banking with them for over 10 years now) ," I thought I would balance out some of the negative reviews here as I've got bank accounts with various branches, HSBC, Santander and Virgin. I also have many close friends who are with BANK_NAME and BANK_NAME and in all honesty, BANK_NAME is one of the best out of all of these when it ultimately comes to ease of banking, their apps format to track everything and easily make payments or move money, and ultimately their customer service. Sure sometimes you don't get amazing service but no bank is perfect, and all of my problems have always been resolved or BANK_NAME has always accepted if they were at fault and compensated me for it. BANK_NAME is also quite responsive to feedback and from my experience, have always taken their complaints seriously. "

Customer_279," Barlcays great customer service. Answer the phone in peak periods, answered questions. "," Went onto Halifax website to setup joint account. Lets you go quite far into application process, then says it can't be processed, so you have to call them. You call them and they tell you this is normal with all banks. That you can't setup joint accounts online with any banks. That we have to call in and do it on phone when we're both present. So we did that. Took nearly 10 mins for the phone to be answered initially, then the lady transferred us to the joint account/set up account or whatever team. After 25 mins we hung up. Tried calling again and got a automated message saying it would take 10 - 22mins to answer our call! Seems you can't call Halifax at lunch or after work.BANK_NAME answered the phone immediately. They also have much better opening hours. And you can set up joint account with them online! - despite what Halifax said about all banks. "

It's not good enough I run a cash based company and this level if service from BANK_NAME is very poor I will be banking else where.

BANK_NAME have a branch close to me, so I thought they would be convenient. They called to set up an appointment, which was 10 days away... ok, I settled for that. Unfortunately, I had to postpone the meeting for a day or so, but then BANK_NAME couldn't offer me another appointment with a Business Manager any ANY local branches for another 2 weeks. Seriously? Sorry... I'll do my business banking elsewhere. If it's this hard to give them my business, imagine what that relationship's going to be like when I need banking facilities. No thanks BANK_NAME. "

Customer_29,A bank thats lost direction,"Hi have been banking with BANK_NAME for about 6 years. I moved my accounts from BANK_NAME to BANK_NAME and initially it was a good experience.   However consistant failure to listen to instructions have taken its toll on my relationship with the bank. Particulary business banking.   They took away the business managers, and centralised it into this call centre 'team' who barely understand the difference between a sole trader and ltd company status, and that is worrying. I have asked several times for my account details to be changed from a previous sole tradership name to the correct ltd companies name, that should have been when i opened the account, its at companies house and they still get it wrong!  Never have i met such a bunch of badly trained, disinterested bunch of advisors. Plus you close branches so local businesses cant access convenient locations to deposit cash and do general day to day banking. You havent got a clue, business banking is NOT the same as retail banking and we NEED and DEMAND our branches back.  I get cross now everytime i walk into a branch of BANK_NAME, becouse you have 15 or so staff standing around with ipads, with some sickly cheesey grin on thier faces all unable to do anything but pester you as soon as you walk into the bank. These people would normally be at other branches, the ones you closed beforehand actually doing a job like paying money in for you or helping with business matters.   BANK_NAME was once an organisation that helped you, it was a well oiled machine and a service you could depend on.   Now it's just a shallow brand name, with no direction, no actual value to the customer, and is a husk, a shell of what it once was. It wont surprise me if they end up with bottled water behind the counters and start serving cake to customers instead, they are that confused with their identity.   I only bank with them because i dont want to have to inconvenience my loyal customers by changing banks again.  BANK_NAME PLEASE TAKE NOTE. AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT....PLEASE.."
Customer_290, Mind-blowingly bad! ," In truth if I were able to award 0, I would.  Banking with BANK_NAME is just the most mind-blowingly bad experience.  Like so many banking customers I started with BANK_NAME as a child and have never moved.  I'm just as lazy today as I've ever been, and the last thing I want to do is to go through the effort of moving bank, but being with BANK_NAME has got to the point where I'm unable to do the most basic banking tasks.  I hold a business account with them, but I've literally been forced to move because there are so many tasks that I cannot do, and those that I can take me so much longer and are so much more painful than they should be.BANK_NAME is broken.Bring on the challenger banks and let this dinosaur fail.

Customer_291, Terrible service over the past 3 years … ," Terrible service over the past 3 years for both personal and business accounts. Catalogue of errors: the staff don't know what they are doing, massively under-trained and know next to nothing. Telephone banking is a bad joke and a complete waste of time. They failed to record change of address details both online and in-branch, then lied about it, sent new debit card to wrong address THREE TIMES, cancelled my pin number then re-activated it without telling me resulting in me being stranded abroad with no means of payment. Cannot/will not/don't know how to send out paper bank statements despite them being essential for my business but they charge me for them anyway. I have received £350 in compensation from them due to them being utterly useless and will be changing banks as soon as I find one that's half decent. "

Went to the one in Mitcham (Croydon). Man at the desk was suppose to update my address. Not sure what was he doing but he was doing something on the computer. After he completed that part I've asked him for a new card. Again he did something on a computer and at the end said it was done and I should receive new card within 5 days. Didn't get it so called Call Centre just to be told he didn't do it properly and that I have to go back to the branch. Tried to explained to lady that I'm full time working single mum with 2 kids and it's not that easy to find time and that I need it to be resolved asap but she couldn't do anything. She asked if I want to make a complain only if that will make any difference. Went to the branch in Wellington High Street and it took lady 5 minutes and card was posted within 2 days. But now... I'm switching my account to Halifax. Do not need that hassle anymore

Every time i have called the bank i have been told someone will be calling me back within 24 hours, no one every called me back. I was then told the money would be back in my account still no money! I have called again today to be told that the money will not be in my account until the 20th July 2017.

Customer_301, Useless absolute useless , Useless absolute useless. Though their profits indicate differently. Four times I was redirected today between various branches. All had the same glum I don't care/give a crap about your interest.But who is better? 
Customer_302, A year or two ago ," A year or two ago, they replaced all the counters at my local branch, bar one, with ATMs.  I like to use the counter, but with only one left, it can take up to 30 mins to be served.  The bank's staff know what I think.  So what do they do?  They all empathise (probably been on a course) and ignore me.  One tried to sell me something when I complained about receiving unsolicited phone calls.  Today, the person who I think might be their branch manager, told me off for upsetting a customer.   I do not think they accept the bank's changes are root cause of my unhappiness.  I have been a customer for this lot for 40 years, but given they way they behave, you would not know it.  If you are thinking of setting up an account, give this bunch of oiks a wide berth.  Dreadful place. "
Customer_303, I am very disappointment. , I am very disappointment.i am  three times failed with access Authoritarian.when i use online any booking activities or booking etc. I feel think about change different new  bank comapny because  I am aware because i  understand to pay 16 pound for  staff responisble thier BANK_NAME. I went face to face staff > They had been phoned direct over sort out with Authoritarin . when i going home . Still failed  access.I unable phone. i am deaf person. 
Customer_304, Appalling customer service , They have made an error with my mortgage. Can't get through to speak to someone. Messaging system pointless as some idiot keeps avoiding answering my question. Problem still not resolved. I will NEVER EVER use BANK_NAME again. Absolutely appalling customer service! 
Customer_305, Stuck in the Dark Ages ," I opened 2 savings accounts with BANK_NAME. I can access neither of them from an app (because you don't have a current account"") and their online system is a nightmare labyrinth of passwords"

Customer_307, I wanted to open a BANK_NAME Smart … ," I wanted to open a BANK_NAME Smart Investor account, but needed a BANK_NAME current account first. So proceeded to set up a current account online, it was great asked me some questions and after about 15 minuites the current account was open. I thought it was great.So onto the Smart Investor site I went, used my user details to open the account, then was redirected to my current account where a box pops open a telling me I need Pinsentry activation for smart investor, so I click ok and the box disappears and nothing, no instructions, nothing but by current account details.So I go back to the Smart investor site and try logging in, I'm taken right back to my current account, so after a quick scan I try opening smart investor from my current account and am asked for a Pinsenty code which I dont have because I dont have a card reader. But it says if I use mobile banking then the Pinsentry app is on there. So I download BANK_NAME Mobile banking app and I'm asked to register using the Pinsentry method, but I cant I dont have the device, but it say I can register Mobile banking by using an atm so of to town I go and register. Get home and try logging into Smart investor it askes my for my Pinsentry code, I open my mobile app and the friggin thing says I have to wait 10 days for the pinsentry to activate on my phone..What a bloody joke, BANK_NAME IS A LUMBERING DINOSAUR IN THE MODERN WORLD!!!! "
Customer_308, Really slow. Really bad service ," I would have given zero stars but unfortunately, it's not an option!! In their wisdom, the company I work for decided to bank with BANK_NAME. I've been in the queue in Bletchley now for over 10 minutes just to pay money in. There are more staff wandering around doing nothing than there are behind the counter. Really slow service. Bank elsewhere!!! "

Customer_31,Can't believe how they treated me at,Can't believe how they treated me at Redcar branch am disabled travelled from guisborough to open 2 accounts took all proof of ID.and statements from existing bank. Advisor said could not open accounts cos statements not posted to me. I got them from my bank that day. Was so shocked  went to Lloyd's with same id opened account within 10 minutes. . Went to post office opened another account in ten minutes. They were good to me as I'm disabled. BANK_NAME treated me like dirt. Lloyd's and post office said it was disgusting how BANK_NAME treated me.
Customer_310, Terrible awful....bank elsewhere ," Ive been a BANK_NAME account holder ever since they took over the Woolwich......recently i cancelled a direct debit to talk talk as i was changing to Sky....not only did they cancel that they also cancelled a direct debit i had with talkmobile...so unknown to me this resulted in a massive bill of £82.50 from £12.50....i had to call talkmobile to reset the standing order, the helpful customer service guy i spoke with also reduced the amount on the bill.....but it was still way higher than I'm used to....i contacted BANK_NAME via web chat to Vicky Saini who was aware that talk talk and talk mobile were different companies but couldn't do anything about their error....not even an apology .....im seriously considering changing banks as this is one of too many costly errors to count. "
Customer_311, BANK_NAME Bank - The Bank of Fails ," It's 2017. I try to transfer £25 to my daughter using pingit to get a cab. Pingit returns an error code of p2001. However the message on the screen advises me to call BANK_NAME on the customer service number, but reassuringly, I won't have to explain. ( yeah right  I believe that) but let's see...   Obviously the person who wrote the error code message hadn't spoken to the BANK_NAME customer service team as after 20 minutes, of explaining and 'going through security' the meaning of this generic code is that the transfer may not have worked and I should try again later! Wow, thank you to BANK_NAME for that explanation. I'll pass that information onto my daughter who had been waiting 20mins for the money to get a cab. Maybe Uber will use that reassurance that my daughter may be able to pay, but if she can't they should try again later. "
Customer_312, Truly appalling service from BANK_NAME ," Truly appalling service from BANK_NAME.  We instructed them by letter to transfer £60,000 from our Savings Account to our Current Account before we issued a cheque for £50,000.  Before we wrote the cheque we checked with them that they had our transfer instruction.  The problem was they didn't action it and as a result we went overdrawn.  We have made several phone calls now to sort it out and were on the phone for over an hour yesterday.  First they said the letter hadn't been signed in accordance with the mandate.  I had a copy of the signed letter in front of me and could see that it had been signed as per the mandate.  I insisted on this point and then they went away and then came back and said that the reason the transfer hadn't been made was that they no longer took customer's instructions by letter.  This is preposterous but in any event they should have given us prior notice of this if this is really true.  Their attitude is dreadful.  It is like speaking to zombies.  No-one has any common sense or interest in helping the customer, everything is driven by process.  We still haven't resolved it and they now say the only way they will make the transfer is if our two signatories go into a branch with identity documents and do it there.  This is easier said than done and is going to need a two hour round trip for one of our signatories.  We have a standing order to amend next month and if they won't do this with a signed letter I don't know how we are going to do this.  Bear in mind that we are not paying a third party but merely transferring money between our accounts with them.There is zero commitment to customer service, their processes are not at all customer friendly and they are dreadful to deal with.  I don't know where their call centre is physically located but the first member of staff I talked to  had a very strong foreign accent and this combined with a poor quality phone line (which makes me think the call centre was abroad) meant he was difficult to understand and he also did not appear to fully grasp the issues.As a bank they have totally lost the plot of what they are there for and have a poor attitude as far as customer service is concerned.  A bank to avoid. "
Customer_313, BANK_NAME Scam Texts Beware ," BANK_NAME has their sms service where they send you info to your mobile of your transactions, maintenance and other information related to your account. Currently there are scam texts going through the same route under the same contact on BANK_NAME behalf. We have detected a suspicious transfer made from your account for 2500 GBP - MMWC LtdIf this is your payment"
Customer_314, Promptly resolve problems- Great service ," I switched from Halifax, where I was appalled by the service I received- money stolen from my account and accused me of doing it myself, being hung up on multiple times, etc. BANK_NAME have always been fabulous to deal with. Recently I took out a BANK_NAME card with them to help build my credit history and the card arrived very promptly and was easy to register. When it came to paying my first statement the online system kept throwing me out so I called and spoke to two very helpful people who resolved the issue within minutes. My local branch are also really good at helping with queries so well done to BANK_NAME for your customer service. "

Customer_32,What the actual fck,So now you can t pay anymore cash to an account in bank branch. What the actual fck? What about for people that want to pay rents and don t owe a bank card. This is totally bullish and they are bothering me so much with the letters to apply for an BANK_NAMEcard. I don t want that. If I would like to apply I would do that myself. Not recommended!
Customer_320, Voice security or not , Please  do not follow my example and sign up to BANK_NAME voice security.  Since I signed with them I have been unable to access my account through the automated system I get referred to a personal banker.  I chose to come out of that system and was assured that it would revert back to my previous security.  This has not happened and I am still being put through to a personal banker.  Wasting my time.  I have spent 42 mins trying to get this resolved to no avail.  Am now waiting for a floor manager to contact their it dept then phone me back.  His words sometime maybe the next few days or not.  In the meantime I am still not able to access my account without going through a personal banker.  Wake up don't sign for voice security. 
Customer_321, Offered me 35k loan based on my credit … , Offered me 35k loan based on my credit then when I asked for 15 k i got offered a higher rate than expected. Thought I had no other option and then they declined on affordability when I earn over 3k and month with outgoings under half. TSB offered a cheaper rate and accepted me fully so my opionion of BANK_NAME is awful now. I will be switching my bank to TSB as a result. Much better bank and lender and are straight about everything upfront. 
Customer_322," Good bank, happy with the service "," Been banking with BANK_NAME since I was about 12 years old and never had any major problems. Their banking app and website are easy to use and the customer service is mostly good, although the staff in their smaller branches are quite often clueless and I've even been told to 'google it' before when they don't know the answer to a question. When I make a payment it comes out of my account immediately which I think is really important in keeping track of your spending etc.I started off on a young persons account which got changed to a student account when I went to uni, this was fine except I had a lot of trouble trying to get my overdraft increased as you only start off with £200, and the maximum they ever let me go to was £300 so not ideal if you need to borrow more than that. My friend also banks with BANK_NAME and had her overdraft refused as she had Topshop on her bank statement, even though she could've been buying socks or something for all they knew! I'm now on a graduate account and am happy with it.I also have a savings account with BANK_NAME but am hoping to change it soon as I get very little interest with it. However my Help to Buy ISA is great and was very easy to set up as I already banked with them. "
Customer_323, Ripped off with Renewal Quote , Ripped off with Renewal QuoteHome contents insurance through BANK_NAME had been good right up until this years renewal which came in at 50% more than last year. I've had 2 claims with them and they say that shouldn't affect the policy but they claim that despite their policy document clearly stating this that they take in to account all claims. Not what they put in writing and not what I paid for.

Customer_329, Vacant & appalling  customer service ," WARNING !!! The ATM at the George Street Branch in Altrincham UK is EATING debit cards and the staff REFUSE to do anything about it. I was there today a little after 4pm when the machine ate my New York TD Bank debit card  i complained the manager and staff all knew about the issue and did nothing to do resolve it or help. They aren't rude, oh no, rather much much worse, they are zombies, lacking empathy, spouting nonsense instead of taking charge and owning up to their errors. While i was there it ate 2 other peoples cards and as I was leaving it was hapening to another.  STILL no sign NOT TO USE THE MACHINE. They will NOT give you card back, were completely unsympathetic, did nothing to help, brushed me off and told me to issue a complaint.  The worst attempt at customer service i have ever witnessed. I am extremely disappointed in how i was treated and how i need to fend for myself without any access to my money. If I could give negative stars I would .....just what the world DOESN'T need more bankers who can't think on their feet or outside the box to help people when it was BANK_NAME equipment who was to blame. Simply useless and vacant. "
Customer_33,Overall BANK_NAME has been a good bank,Overall BANK_NAME has been a good bank for me. I've had a few hickups with them but they resolved them and also offered a goodwill credit.  What I probably like the best with BANK_NAME's is their in-bank statement print-out and account service which you can use on your own. I wish all the other banks had the same. You just pop your card in the machine and you get the option to print out statements. And the archives go back by about 2+ years.   What I dislike about BANK_NAME is the online account access. There seem to always be a problem with it. I don't use it anymore because I always have problems logging in. Luckily for me BANK_NAME's is around the corner so I don't need the online service per say but otherwise it would be pretty frustrating.
Customer_330, failed complaint handling and no customer service ," 2 stars for how long i was with them and how useful they were for about 15-18 years!! but poor form from BANK_NAME having logged a complaint and they fail to even look at it until 7 days after the final date of response! Also when I last went in to branch they were useless and they just point you to a pc unless you want a mortgage or loan off them. (mines with other companies who offer better rates!) first thing im doing saturday is leaving BANK_NAME and moving banks. Hopefully they will have staff who can actually talk to you in branch about your account and not point you at a pc, if i wanted a pc i would have stopped at home! "
Customer_331, Worst service at BANK_NAME in 25 years as a customer… ," 25 years as a customer and now Customer Service at BANK_NAME is at its lowest quality in all that time.The branches in larger towns lack any customer focus at all.  A large team of pouncing"" staff directing you to their automated services with half of the staff just smiling and twiddling their thumbs whilst there is a queue of 10 people needing to deal face to face with the ONE or if you are lucky TWO tellers.The queues diminish more quickly not because of service but because people cant wait any longer and have to leave the bank walking past the smiling thumb twiddling staff.Call their customer service line and you are guaranteed(after the long wait) to get someone who has no ability to just for a second effectively stand in the customers shoes.  If they are unable to answer your question they are not allowed to pass you on to one of theirs ""not customer facing staff"" but instead register your very basic enquiry as a ""Complaint"" which gives them up to 8 weeks  to respond to your enquiry and all of a sudden the ""complaint"" becomes more of an issue than your original enquiry.Their CEO to me is completely out of touch with the real world and clearly does not monitor their calls or spend time in their branches - if he did thinks would be much better as they used to be.  No wonder BANK_NAME are the most complained about bank - their structure turns everything into a complaint.When you get an outcome to your complaint they just want to throw their shareholders money at you and thank you for the feedback !All they need to do is put their staff in the ""right"" places and properly equip their staff to answer the questions asked by customers. """
Customer_332, Disappointing attitude and service ," Very disappointing attitude and service. Makes a drama out of the most straightforward simple things. They failed to send me a PIN, then refused to allow me to access my own account even after correctly answering security questions. Then they sent me a PIN which didn't work, and refused to request another one for me, and only did so after I offered to answer security questions, and showed them a letter from their own customer services department in response to the initial complaint, in which it clearly said, If a customer does not have their PIN with them"
Customer_333, Stay away , Stay away. They don't protect their customers. They don't care their customers 
Customer_334, Been a customer for only 9 months ," Been a customer for only 9 months, I find the service incomparable and absolutely spot on.  Yes a lot of checks and questions needs to be dealt with for any kind of application but is it not the least you should expect from a serious financial institute?  Once you have their trust and they have yours, it can only feel like it is the beginning of a long, solid relationship. "
Customer_335," Have had lots of problems, but always rectified ", Have had lots of problems with my account but BANK_NAME have always accepted responsibility. Compensated for all loses and have always put me in a better position then I would have been if these mistakes had not happend.A++++++* 
Customer_336, Very disappointing ," I have a family member who uses BANK_NAME bank. Money was removed from their account without their knowledge or consent, so the activity was reported to BANK_NAME as fraudulent. BANK_NAME refunded the money... but then sent a letter to say that after an investigation, BANK_NAME had determined that the payment had been authorised by the account holder (not true) and therefore it did not count as fraud. This contradicts guidance given by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). A letter to this effect was sent by recorded delivery. BANK_NAME never responded to the letter and then withdrew the money that they had refunded. Not at all professional and I would never recommend them. "
Customer_337, After 3 months this account is pretty … ," After 3 months this account is pretty much dead in the water. I opened up an account from BANK_NAME. First of all, I had to wait 5 weeks for the passcode. That was bad enough. When I eventually did get into my account, I went into MOVE MONEY to transfer some funds from that account to a supplier. I got big red letters and an error code of 9802. Back I went to BANK_NAME physically and online. Went through all the procedure, got complaint ref numbers, call ref numbers explained in simple terms to what seemed like an Indian Call Centre more call ref numbers, more complaint ref numbers. The bloke at the local branch came to the conclusion that the account had been deactivated.  He battled away. The online team was blaming the normal account team and vice-versa. Anyway, I've had enough. Like the people below, went to BANK_NAME. Not a problem with them. Up and running. BANK_NAME - ship of fools and not fit for purpose. At 14.26 on 16 May. Account still not capable of making payments. "
Customer_338, Went with my daughter to open her first bank account. ," Went with my daughter to open her first bank account. First tried to phone call centre to make appointment, could not make the lady in India understand. So I hung up. Went on live chat to make the appointment, it took close to 30mins to sort the appointment . I was told 3.30 on Monday. Went to the bank at 3.30 and was told the appointment was  scheduled for 2.30. I had a screen shot of the appointment. Then they told myself and my daughter that her provisional driving license , birth certificate , NHS card , National insurance number letter. A  recent utility bill  and my passport was not enough  for identification  purposes . And they could not open her a 16-19 yr old account.  Wonderful how stupid. So I walked down to BANK_NAME bank asked if they could squeeze us in.  Pleasant chatty people said yes .They asked for identification I showed in the selection of things  we had  and they said provisional driving license is just perfect photo ID. So anyone thinking about  BANK_NAME Bank just don't bother go to BANK_NAME . "
Customer_339, Constant issues with mortgage from day one. ," Very poor service when trying to administer an old ING Direct mortgage online.  They insist I open a current account to allow me Internet access (Mis-selling?).  Phone service is abysmal, provided by Indian call-centre staff with a poor grasp of English and an even worse attitude problem who will put you on permanent hold if they don't know how to deal with an issue.  Don't bother going into the branches to sort out, the staff there are at the mercy of support from the call centre so doomed from the start.  Best advice is to ask for a complaint reference number each time you call, let the UK complaints team attempt to solve the issue then get the Ombudsman involved when they can't (or refuse).Even better advice is not to bank with them at all, unfortunately I'm  stuck with a mortgage with a very favourable rate at the moment, but seriously considering giving it up to avoid the constant hassle that BANK_NAME seems to like to inflict on its customers. "
Customer_34,Stressful experience,"I am a new customer and wanted to use the cashback offers. However when I try to use them I am given a message saying access is forbidden. I spoke to customer services who said I need to upgrade to BANK_NAME Blue in order to be able to use the cashback. I know this is not correct as it says the following on their website;  if you re registered for BANK_NAME Blue Rewards you could earn an extra 1% cashback&#8221;. This suggests to me that you don t  need BANK_NAME Blue to get the initial cashback, I then tried using the Livetalk option throug the app which I have to say was abysmal. I tried 8 TIMES to get a response and each time they took so flipping long to respond to my question that the app timed out and I had to start again. One time the agent did not respond to me at all during a 12 minute chat.  Low and behold this morning I get an email thanking me for registering for cashback offers which I did not and I  not a BANK_NAME Blue member so this contradicts what I was told by customer services.  I have now given up and will be moving my banking to a bank where the customer services know what they are talking about. BANK_NAME used to be a good bank but they have declined rapidly over the last few years. They are spending too much on their digital offering and not enough on their customer services plus removing counters from their branches and not even opening on a Saturday!  Terrible bank!"
Customer_340, Tech pack.. No help. , Don't waste your time with the BANK_NAME Tech pack. Sent my iPhone off for repair.

Advisor straight away also if I'd like to make another claim and pay £50 excess. I refuse and put through to customer relations and may have to pay an excess if they believe I caused the damage. They offer little assistance.....BANK_NAME won't help as the complaint is with there chosen service provider. Waste of money! 
Customer_341, Bad service , I got very bad experience about this bank. And I not recommend people to use the bank at all. I were ask in branch bank services to help to order years statement about to proof change my new passport and notice very important and urgent. Twice times ask them their say to me to between 7 days ! First time I been wait for a month  and second time I wait for 3 weeks almost 2 months. This is very bad service and  no responsibility at all! 
Customer_342, Endless queues and malfunctioning machines , My local branch in Liverpool is chronically understaffed. Long queues are the norm. There are 3 malfunctioning machines which have taken the place of real people. BANK_NAME are making billions in profit but treat their customers with contempt. Been a customer for 25 years. Am looking to move - probably to Nationwide 
Customer_343, BROKERS WHO SHOULD NEVER BE TRUSTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMCISES< SORRY CIRCUMSTANCES LOL ," BANK_NAME Stockbrokers CFD and Spread Trading and gain Capital who are associated with them, should both, never be trusted under any circumcises, sorry circumstances LOL heres why: What they do is, okay for example, you enter a trade at 165 USD per CFD unit long with a target price of 190 and a stop loss of 162, on such and such a day, it goes down to 163.50 and then rallies up to say 170, theyll close you out at maybe 161 and when you complain the price didnt reach that level, theyll refer you to look at the bid chart, youll see it went down to 163.50 low of the day and point it out, then they just claim it was down to world time differences, obviously BS. As we all know what time it happened in one part of the world to another is of total irrelevence. But they will just stick by the story. If you have an account with them, best to draw all what you have left and go elsewhere, it is impossible to win with this sort of thing going on. The whole platform is therefore just completely unsafe to use. "
Customer_344, If i I could give zero star ," If i I could give zero star, I would! Staff in Warrington branch are useless!

But seems at this bank we are just a number. I gonna switch to Halifax. "
Customer_345, ABYSMAL COST CUTTING SERVICE ," Unfortunately I cannot give BANK_NAME Bank zero stars for their customer service. Both their online 'chat' and telephone  customer care services are abysmal.  I used their online chat service recently, and the  agents who I spoke to (four of them) decided to just not bother repling to my questions when they didn't understand, which was  most of the time, they just left the chat running without typing anything. I was on one chat for 30 minutes waiting for a reply. I then had to resort to telephone customer services and the guy who answered was obviously reading from his online script, which he was struggling with and really had no idea what I was talking about. I am not blaming this person, as I can speak no Hindi whatsoever. I am blaming BANK_NAME for providing a shoddy cost cutting service. If you are going to  provide a service for English speaking people, use people who speak English for that service! I have banked with BANK_NAME for over 30 years but will now be taking my custom elsewhere "
Customer_346, Disgraceful 'service' or complete lack of it ," No stars. I am so frustrated and disgusted with BANK_NAME. I live in Australia and all I need is a pin number Sent to me so I can use my card when I visit England in a months time.I call the number advertised on the BANK_NAME site and get an Indian call centre. Let's just say I repeated my postcode 8 times and he still could not understand. I could barely understand what he was saying,. I believe the details he managed to muster and input into his system were probably incorrect.the result being that ' I failed'  the security  questions and therefore he 'could not discuss the account with me.This is the short version, I was on the call for 45 mins from Aus to UK probably cost $30 +All absolutely pointless. He told me to write a letter and sign it and ask them for a pin, they can send one then. I said this will take up to a month by which point I'll be in the UK. He told me to rethink the abswers tobmy security questions. I know my own freaking mothers maiden name and and know my freaking address.I said can I get a new pin number from the bank branch when I'm in england then, he said they'll send it to my address. ( which is in Australia) so will be pointless.OMG what the hell! Who are these spuds. I'm so angry. So now I'll have to go into bank branch with passport, drivers license, etc ....and withdraw wads if cash and hope 1. I don't lose it    2.dont get muggedBANK_NAME's are completely unhelpful and When I get to UK I will take all my money and close this crap bank for good. "
Customer_347, Blaming the customer , Everytime I get paid transactions are coming from my bank account at first it was amount such as 64 pound a week ridiculous  amounts and now even though I have phoned 3 times for my bank to stop direct debit and iv have 24 pound fees on my bank account 8 pound today for not paying my direct debit even tho it was canceled from  the actually business and the bank account but I'm still getting charge apparently it's my fault and not even been refunded I'm finding a new bank and if ur only just signing up I'd say not too really shocking 
Customer_348, Absolute disgrace , Absolute disgrace. Computerized switchboard service which is impractical and inadequate. Call waiting times are excessive. Calls eventually answered in Mumbia with poorly speaking agents who dont know what they are talking about. Honestly never experienced such shocking customer service. Stay away from this bank. 
Customer_349, Do not use them! ," Yet again BANK_NAME's make life impossible. I registered for internet banking and first discovered they had the wrong address on record but I then succeeded. The next time I tried to login I was asked for different information I didn't have, then I was shut out and told to ring. When I did I was told they didn't have sufficient verification and could do no more and I would have to go into a branch.The other complaint is trying to find the correct number to call, the website keeps sending you round in circles.

Customer_35,"BANK_NAME Home Insurance (actually Aviva), Legal Expenses - AVOID waste of money","BANK_NAME Home Insurance - Legal Expenses cover What a deceitful company and waste of time having this cover. First I was never dealing with BANK_NAME as it turned out it was Aviva, who do everything they can to be unhelpful and basically avoid wanting to pay out. I am appalled. Horrid experience. This has now cost me £12,000 in legal expenses and I won my case on all for counts.  You take out legal expenses cover for peace of mind in case its needed. The amount of stress they put me under never ever again. Deceitful untrustworthy company and I am also a business customer with them too, so I will now look to move everything away from them as soon as possible."

Customer_352, Terrible customer service and opaque bank ," Terrible customer service. I have had a BANK_NAME account for 17 years now and never bothered to change but think it's about time now.I keep getting through to a customer service centre in India every time I call and put on hold every whenI have a specific question. They have been useless at answering any queries and I usually get a different answer depending on the person at the other end of the line.My card was subject to fraud recently and BANK_NAME do not give automatic refund, it's a painless process through their Fraud department and waiting for enquiries (even though the amounts are small).I've been charge OD fees even though I am a premier banking customer. Only to find out that my account was downgraded without me being notified. The answer I get is that BANK_NAME are able to change their terms and conditions at any point without notifying the customer and will not be responsible for any fees charged to account as a result. Incredible!Total lack of transparency and customer service with this bank. "

Customer_354, Terrible and slow customer service , Terrible and slow customer service with ridiculous waiting times and customer service operators with foreign accents far too thick to understand. I have been transferred from department to department and made to wait for far too long. 
Customer_355, Terrible customer services and rates on everything. Should've left years ago… ," Terrible customer services/ complaint management experience led me to leave BANK_NAME after 15 years. I was a good customer who caused no issues and they offered nothing worthwhile over that time period when many other banks do. Was really needing an excuse to leave as only familiarity kept me there and that excuse came! Worst rates for everything compared to most other banks. Switched in 7 days via Martin Lewis, got bonuses & never looked back. Easy process and so pleased I've done it. Should've done it years ago. Thanks for essentially nothing BANK_NAME! I've voted with my feet and reviewed here to share my disappointing experience like I said I would. "
Customer_356, BANK_NAME are a horrible company ," BANK_NAME are a horrible company. I have just tried to paid a company which I have paid twice before, hey have blocked my card even through I responded to the text from the Bank saying that I was happy paying this company! Now I have just rang them to get them to turn my card back on they will not do it unless I download their phone app! When I refused to download this app onto my phone they stated that they will not sort out my card and the only why to do it is to go into the Bank! How can you do this when you are at work? So unless I can get into a Bank tomorrow I will be left on a Bank Holiday with no money! Keep well away from BANK_NAME, as soon as I can get into town I will be changing my BANK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
Customer_357, BANK_NAME are a horrible company to bank … , BANK_NAME are a horrible company to bank for! They have put my account under review without my knowledge and I have been in a situation now for 3 week without no access to money because I work long hours and unable to get to an actual branch and withdraw my money. They have been so rude to saying I'm a silly little girl when I tried to make a account. I am in the process of switching banks and BANK_NAME have refused to help me switch banks. They told me it is in their terms and conditions that they can place my account under review at any time but due to having a young persons account first they did not sent me the current account terms and conditions as they done that process automatically. 
Customer_358, Ajay Sharma At The Hornchurch Branch , I'm a BANK_NAME business customer and have had a nightmare until dealing with Ajay Sharma in the Hornchurch branch. Whilst he is on the personal banking team he took an hour and a half out of his day to help me out. Prior to this is was really displeased with the service and he has changed my opinion.Great customer service and very knowledgable. 
Customer_359, Worst bank ever in UK ," Worst bank ever in UK, I so regret even trying to apply, what a big mistake. 2 months ago I applied for a BANK_NAME Business current account after 2 months with a lot of back and forth with hundreds of excuses from the business manager in Hagley Road branch, Birmingham, I filled up a complain about it and they never answered me back ,didnt even bother to read my formally written complains, I ended up giving up, I applied for a BANK_NAME business account they opened my account in 2 businesses days. Really people stay away from this guys they WILL waste your time and dont even care about you!!!!!I hate this bank so much, I cant even describe how disappointed I am, ruining people's dreams every day!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
Customer_36,Stole my money,"Stole my money, cancelled my debit card last week and said they are stealing it for 10 days under review, have never done anything dodgy on the account they left me with ZERO out of all wages and a recent loan from relative which is for a operation which I can no longer have. This has seriously affected my health and on top of that they have put me in debt now. It is the worst bank I can say that from experience from a few but this is ridiculous, best bit is they couldn't even tell me why they have done this. Absolutely discraceful behaviour from a bank. I hope you get televised sometime about your operations as I will glady stand against you. Will be looking at a claim of compensation against the bank for stress, bad ill health, unable to get about anywhere including work, no food, nothing!!! DO NOT BANK WITH BANK_NAME you have no control of your finances they do what they want. Forgot to mention, yes they have blocked the whole account, not just the card. I can access nothing, not by counter and not by app, app has been deregistered by them. Have got no-one to really go to so have pretty much starved since last Thursday. The block was by a txt message to my mobile. Say's it all about them doesn't it. THANKS BANK_NAME may as well be homeless!!!"
Customer_360," SOLID,STABLE,RELIABLE SERVICE...EXCELLENT "," Have numerous accounts elsewhere but recently opened a BANK_NAME account online,approved overdraft at same time.Painless,easy almost instant opening, card and pin received within 3 days.Online banking is good but the app has to be one of the best around,so fast and i can do everything i need to from the app including direct calling customer services if needed with no need to go through any long winded security procedures all over again as they know who you are from the call as its from within the app.Going to open some bonds within BANK_NAME soon.Would recommend to all. "
Customer_361, It is a shame we cannot put 0 star as … ," It is a shame we cannot put 0 star as they have they worst call centre in the world. I spoke to 4 different person in relation to my debit card which was blocked, got 4 different answers. One said my card doesn't exist, another one said it is working, another one said it was blocked and I failed to give the corrects answer, the last one told me to go to a local branch. At the local branch the guy told me that as a BANK_NAME employee he was treated in a worst matter than BANK_NAME customers by their overseas call centre.So if you were thinking about switching your bank account to BANK_NAME, think again! "
Customer_362, the worst chat service in the world ," the worst chat service-  I contacted them by using this platform around 10 times and there wasn't even one instance when the representative was able to have a resolution or sort out an issue, most of the times they would just repeat the same question all over again, the most appaling chat service I have ever encountered and I am not exxagerating. they seem to be completely unfocused, probably overwhelmed with too many chat windows, otherwise I cannot explain the consitent lack of attention. there might be another explanation - complete lack of interest, unprofessionalism and ultimately stupidity. "
Customer_363, BANK_NAME did not apologize for … , BANK_NAME did not apologize for sponsoring the Nazi regime. They are the worst bank in UK with the lowest interest on savings and the worst services overall. Do not use this bank!!! 
Customer_364, Poor staff knowledge and attitude , Poor staff knowledge and attitude. Didn't want to upgrade my child's account and reasons were ridiculous finally admitted they were understaffed! Before BANK_NAME was a good bank buymt due to understaffing and employing unprofessional ignorants it went downhill and I am moving my money to paragon bank. 
Customer_365, Enquiry to open an account , I just went in there to enquire about opening an account. The lady in there was not at all welcoming and looks like they don't want people to come in to open the account. She was more happy to say you can open somewhere else before even knowing what I need. I think BANK_NAME will head towards shutdown if they have people like this talking to customer.This was ealing broadway branch 
Customer_366, Basil Faulty school of Customer Service ," I tried to ring register my fathers death at Hoyland , Barnsley branch and was met with the worse customer service I have experienced of ANY bank As soon as I explained I wanted to register  the death she bellowed at me that I couldn't do that as she was serving customers "" Absolutely no condolences offered or any semblance of understanding I asked what I needed to do and she told me I needed to make an appointment"
Customer_367, I have had a BANK_NAME account for over … ," I have had a BANK_NAME account for over a year now and have been generally pleased with the service i have received. The online banking is fairly easy to use, i have never phoned their call centre as i barely ever phone my bank and the mobile app is decent enough. My main gripe is that i constantly get mail asking to get overdrafts, loans etc. I already have a BANK_NAMEcard with them, I do not need any extra finance and to be honest i see it is a waste of paper, apart from that I have no issues with them. I also like the fact you can personalise you're debit card with them. Overall a decent bank with no major issues, i just dread the day I have to phone them up if it is as bad as other people say it is "
Customer_368, Booked an appointment , Booked an appointment. Arrived at the branch to find it closed. 
Customer_369, Top service at the Clacton on sea … , Top service at the Clacton on sea branch.They are always helpful and staff there are very helpful at all times even when it's very busy in the branch.Also the telephone banking are fabulous and helpful I had money taken fro my account and they soon sorted it out for me I couldn't ask for better than that I must say BANK_NAME is the best bank I've banked with keep up the great service. 
Customer_37,Recently helped me resolve a complaint,"Recently helped me resolve a complaint with a recalcitrant German fashion website, Wardow, who refused to refund my purchase after their shipment to me was stolen en route.   Under the Visa cardholder protection scheme, BANK_NAME stepped in, contacted Wardow's bank in Germany, and with the evidence I provided to them, obtained a refund from Wardow's bank on my behalf. All in about a week.  The process was professional  and  reassuring and I've got to admit surprising given the banking sector's reputation here in the UK."
Customer_370, Theives. Stay away from them ," In one word, theives. I have had an account with BANK_NAME for 22 years without issue. 3 weeks ago I went to make a payment and it got declined. I then tried to access online banking and received and error with a number to call. I was told that my bank account had been suspended and I should have received a letter. I had not received anything from BANK_NAME. I was out through to the fraud team and was told that the account was closed and they were not able to tell me the reason why and I should 'refer to my terms and conditions'. The suggestion being I had violated them. I have a regular, boring account: wages in, direct debits out. Same every month. So I went to the branch near work, same response. All they could do was log a complaint. I was assured it was being fast tracked and someone would call me back that afternoon. Of course no one called. I then decided to try Twitter. I spoke to a lady on there who was very nice and called me to discuss. She also was unable to give me any information but told me to go back to the branch with proof of income. So the next day I went to my local branch with 6 months of payslips, my employment contract, three utility bills, my passport and drivers license. Two hours of valiant effort by the staff at the Croydon branch ended up hopeless. They were told by HQ they would not release the funds from my bank account over the counter and I would have to post all the documents to an address in Coventry. I did this the following day along with a covering letter. I received a response that my query would be dealt with by 12th April. Guess what? Today is the 12th April and I have had no response. They are currently holding all of my funds, not replying to anything, wasting my time not to mention causing me unsure stess ans embarrassment. I have had to live on borrowed money from friends for three weeks. I am a single person with a mortgage and no means to pay. All for nothing. It's atrocious. I have since got a new account with BANK_NAME but I need that money in my BANK_NAME account. It's going to be a battle and it's very frustrating. On the plus side, I have a very large following on social media and my good friend is an Editor at The Guardian so currently writing all of this down to hopefully name and shame in the press. My advice, keep pushing them, log a complaint with the ombudsmen and if nothing happens go to the press and consider filing a case with the small claims court. Document everything and record all phone calls. Theives. Stay well away. "
Customer_371, COWBOYS!! ," I opened an account for my son when he was 15 years old. At the age of 16 he was able to run the account without me. During the summer last year he got a little job cash in hand helping out a friend, doing odd jobs as he had just opened a restaurant. My son decided he would save up to go on a skiing trip the following year. 8 months later my son had offered his services to few friends for cash, again odd jobs. His account was flourishing! He brought himself a PlayStation and was so proud of his achievements and independence. However, just before Christmas he went to withdraw cash to be told his account had been frozen due to fraud and that someone would be in touch. As a 16 year old boy he assumed it was under control.  A month went by and he heard nothing so I decided to intervene.It transpired that over £3000 was put in and paid out and two accounts were opened in his name, one of which was an ISA which we discovered used a fake NI number. The bank decided they no longer wanted to be my sons bank and closed his account. They CANNOT ascertain where the money came from, they are not concerned that the other accounts were set up with fake ID and without my sons consent either. When I asked them why my son was not alerted to a new account payee been set up (as usually they text you to confirm it's you) they had no answer. So basically they are condoning fraud and poor defenceless children are NOT safeguarded against fraud. They are a bunch of cowboys. My son has lost almost £800 as they are refusing to give it back. I have now passed comlaint to FOS.Moral of the story , do NOT let anyone under the age of 21 bank with them!!! "

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE "
Customer_373, Who needs this bank? ," Who needs this bank?I tried to open a new Business Account with their Knightsbridge branch in London for a new company. Not only had I waited almost three weeks for the appointment, which by itself is ridiculous, but I soon learned I was no closer to opening an account after all this waiting period. This created a lot of delays for me to get started with the business as I needed a bank account.The BANK_NAME Business Manager"" demanded to get answers to 30+ questions for just opening a basic business account. Everything from share holders details"
Customer_374, Banking at it's worst ," Introducing BANK_NAME Business Banking...have absolutely no concept of the needs of businesses.Applied for an additional signatory on an account 6 weeks ago.  Only communication from them was a letter asking that we re-sign a form or remove the new director from Companies House because their form needed both director signatures (not that that was obvious) - nothing else (no welcome, no online/phone banking details, no debit/credit cards etc).  Chased up to see what was going on, but couldn't get any help through the business telephone banking service because I couldn't pass security because I don't have the information they haven't sent me.  Escalated to a supervisor, and got the same idiotic stance.  Tried to lodge a complaint - just got left on hold for 20 minutes.  Tried to call the local branch, but ended up back with the telephone service in India.  Asked to be put through to the branch and they cut me off. Wow - where now?  How about, BANK_NAME you just send me some info per the service you charge for, and as any competent bank would?Deeply engrained organisational ineptitude, and zero respect for the customer.I would try and move the account...but I can't get into it to even do that!Sadly knowing also that this review will make absolutely no difference to their service or even elicit a response...

Customer_377, junk mail ," Most people may have heard of the BANK_NAME rate fixing scandal and their general unethical behaviour over the years.  This review is just a moan about their relentless junk mail.  Every month without fail the same 'offers' to get into debt with them come through the letterbox.  It's a waste of paper, money and energy.  I've tried everything to get them to stop, but to no avail.  In an age where everyone is encouraging us to 'go paperless' (including BANK_NAME) it's a joke that they keep on churning out more paper in an effort to solicit more profit. "

I advise everyone NOT to bank with BANK_NAME!!! I have lost so much money since being with this bank and problems that STILL havent been resolved...disgusting! AVOID BANK_NAME!!!! 
Customer_381, Terrible ," Have been attempting to get online access to my mortgage account since November 2016.  If you try online to arrange this you go through the process only to receive at the end an error message with a code (and please note that most of their staff do not know what the error code means).  After eventually getting through to someone who did know what to do I was sent a pin number by post and was informed that my membership number would follow in another letter, so that I could get online.  This never arrived.  I have phoned and after answering several security questions, to which I got 'thank you, that is correct' to every answer I gave, I was then informed that I could not go any further as their system had highlighted that I had answered a question wrong.  When asked which question I was told the system did not give them that information.  When asked why they had said 'thank you, that is correct' to every answer I gave, I got no response.  Therefore, after another number of calls I am still no further to getting online access to my mortgage account.  There is no customer service at BANK_NAME, they are a joke. "
Customer_382, Best for online business banking , Recently swapped our accounts from Santander. Very impressive online banking system so happy to recommend

Customer_385, I recently closed all my accounts with BANK_NAME due to very high cost and very low service. ," BANK_NAME misled me, took a long time over the simplest task.I had to constantly put up with awful service and when you walk into a branch you cannot find anyone that can help. They are not a bank that you can rely on to help your business. For a company that has such high costs you would expect better. "
Customer_386," mortgage appointment, forget talking to a human "," All i want to do is discuss several mortgage options to help my daughter by her first home, simple you would think.Nope, after searching a lot for a contact number and going to a continental call centre to be given the number for mortgage appointments, i then found an alternative which i called.all the person on the phone wanted to do was pin me down to which mortgage i wanted , when i explained i wanted to help our daughter to by her first home they insisted on speaking to her, i have all her details and she is at work, so there is nothing more they need, but that would not satisfy them.so i insisted again that i have several options and would like to talk to a human face to face.the reply i got was thats not how we do things sir"" i need to speak with your daughter.so after trying several my times i explained they can not be the bank for us if i cant talk to someone and i will go somewhere else.reply  ""ok sir"
Customer_387, Completely Incompetant ," Can't believe how bad these are. I had an overdraft to pay off which i finished paying off a while back. During this time i set up a new bank account so I did not have any extra money going into the BANK_NAME account so they did not replace my debit card. After paying this off and transferring some money into the account I asked for a new debit card ( my credit rating is really good too). I was told to go into the branch with photo ID. I went into the bank with all my ID and details and asked for a new debit card and authorisation card so i could use this for other parts of the online banking. I also put more money into the bank at the same time. The man behind the counter said he had requested a new debit card for me. I waited for  6 working days as i was told 5. I only received an authorisation card but no debit card. I then progressed to the online chat complaints system who had a conversation with me, she apologised and told me to go back to the branch with my ID and request a debit card again (which is exactly what I had already done) and offered £25 compensation if i was willing to accept this. Before i could accept this, she wrote that connection had been lost even though i was still logged in and typing, so guess what, no compensation. I then complained by secure message online as i now had my authorisation card and received an automated email saying contact within 5 working days, 6 working days later no answer, even though they say they will let you know who is dealing with your complaint. I then decided to complain again and still nothing. As they cannot seem to do anything right and do nothing with regards to my account I decided to transfer all the money I had in my account to my BANK_NAME bank instead. "
Customer_388, Just transferred my bank ," I have just transferred by main current account from Société Générale in France to BANK_NAME in Hammersmith in London with ease.  The whole process took approx. 9 days, and I am now fully active.  I found the website very easy to use, and the telephone support was exceptional.If you are moving your current account from overseas, I highly recommend BANK_NAME.A top bank with great customer support. "
Customer_389, changeing over credit card from another bank . , we have only just joined BANK_NAME about 3 weeks ago transfered our credit card over from another bank because they were so slow we have got a 12 pound fine and will effect are credit score was told it would be sorted before we had to pay our monthly fee we have also transfered saveings over from another bank we are not happy with the service wish we had not bothered . 
Customer_39,Refused service when we had sufficient paperwork evidence of legal residency in the UK,"I had an appointment with Stephanie Hart at the Bury St. Edmunds branch. Before the appointment, I was told by a customer service representative that I would be able to present my military orders (showing that I am stationed in the UK) as sufficient evidence of my residence in the UK, in order to open a currency account. Despite this fact, Stephanie refused to accept the military orders. I presented to her my signed rental lease, which the BANK_NAME website clearly says is acceptable proof of UK residency by stating,  Tenancy agreement (dated within 12 months) from local council or housing association . However, she still persisted to refuse service to us and said that a lease is unacceptable because a fake lease could easily be made. Additionally, she refused all my email correspondence showing that I had set up recurring utility payments in the UK. Stephanie was absolutely no help whatsoever and clearly did not know the rules of the bank she worked for. My wife and I were sent away to come up with better evidence of our residency in the UK and schedule another appointment in which we had waited for 1 week initially. Based off this experience, if you decide to bank with BANK_NAME, avoid the Bury St. Edmonds branch and specifically Stephanie Hart. That appointment was such a waste of our time, gas, and money."
Customer_390, Awful Customer Service , Absolutely awful - rude staff chippy and unhelpful the whole system of how BANK_NAME work is ridiculous. Just refer you to go to the branch constantly. Highly unhelpful. especially in this day and age 
Customer_391, Gratuitous entrapment. ," Today, yet again, 2 letters arrived for my (adult) children containing BANK_NAMEcards. No one in my family even has a BANK_NAME account and I consider the enclosure of an actual card to be a form of gratuitous entrapment, putting temptation into the hands of people who may well not be in financial position to cope with a credit card. Each letter offered a different interest rate, the lower rate being presented for my son who is in much better financial position than my daughter who's proposed interest was a lot higher.I find this type of marketing offensive on so many levels! My children have not lived here for many years so why are these things still coming here? Surely failure to keep up"" opens the way to fraudulent applications?Speculative promotions (literally ""fishing"") cost money which would be better spent improving services and reducing banking rates"
Customer_392, Terrible identity verification system ," Over stringent fraud checks, cant even access my own money with visa debit card despite having the funds in place and able to log onto my online account, now they expect me to go to a branch with ID because I couldnt remember which email account I had used, resulting in a missed crucial investment opportunity. "
Customer_393, Pathetic is an understatement. ," I opened an account with BANK_NAME in 2012. All was going great until mid 2014. After work, on my way home I tried to make a purchase and it was declined due to my account being frozen. Upon phoning up, they told me I had made multiple large payments, reducing my balance to almost zero and subsequently resulting in my card being blocked. After a bit of questioning and discussion with the fraud department, it turns out someone had phoned up impersonating me and gotten access to my account. BANK_NAME refused to take responsiblity and only backed down when I took legal action to get my funds recovered. That, in all fairness should have been a warning to switch banks, but unfortunately for I've stuck with them. Through all that, even to this day.. I'm on hold, in queue for up to 30 minutes on the phone for a basic support request, and no matter what number I phone, even if it's the designated number for the issue I'm enquring about, they still feel the need to transfer me to the wrong department time and time again. On a good take it can take 30-40 minutes to actually get through to the right person. The only thing worse than this, that's happened on more than one occasion, is when I've been on hold for ages, I hear the phone pick up, then go back down again and the call cuts. Why? It seems like they have a valid reason too, but don't think it's because of something I'm doing. I've worked in Customer Services before when I was younger, and I know how much it can ruin your day to have some angry person taking an issue out on you because of a fault that wasn't yours. It's just not something I do, I'm always polite on the phone to Support Staff no matter how pathetic the company itself is being, they are just doing their jobs. It also seems that basic English is not a requirement to work for BANK_NAME support. I've got no problem with people not speaking English, but if they aren't able to.. they should not be doing a support role for English customers. I'm a very clear, native English speaker, I work with people who struggle with English, but so many times I have to get passed to somebody else because I'm not understood no matter how much I simplify it. I even had a friend next to me agree that on one occasion, they should really have no problem understanding me if they spoke basic English. New year, New problems. Over the last few months, BANK_NAME have been putting a security block on my account over the MOST INSIGNIFICANT purchases. So many times I try to buy something only to get my card declined. The reason for the block? I bought McDonalds the same morning. My cards been frozen over 10 times this year and it's only early March. I had my card Frozen after buying beers at my local shop for NYE party.A week later my card was frozen because I paid for a monthly music subscription. I filled my car up and that got my card frozen. A few weeks ago I renewed my gym membership, card frozen agan. I spent £1.80 on parking... £1.80!!!!! and my card was frozen again.a few more stupid ones..Then again last night.. £7 got my card blocked. This is beyond pathetic, I swear my account spends more time blocked than unblocked and EVERY SINGLE TIME it turns out to be legitimate purchases, not fraud. It's like BANK_NAME are intentionally doing this to annoy me. Something is up with their security system. I got off the phone over an hour ago, she told me my card would work again within 15 minutes.. I have just tried to complete the purchase I was in the middle of making and my card is still not working. This is ridiculous. Whatever you do, do not go with BANK_NAME, Go with Santander, BANK_NAME, Anyone else just make sure it's not this trash company. Oh and the App sucks too. "
Customer_394, Unhelpful incompetent staff ," After 11 years with BANK_NAME I'm off to another thanks to thier rude and shocking customer service. I made a large online transfer which seemed to be delayed for security purposes, fine by me that is a good system. However I rang to check how long the process would take and I was advised I need to answer security questions, not a problem. I provided all correct information as I have in all previous communication with this bank and I was told I gave wrong information. The man, who frankly couldn't speak a word of English clearly, blocked my account and hung up on me! I rang back and spoke to a manager who said it would take two hours to listen to the call and investigate. So I waited, did not get a call back. I rang again and was made to wait for 45 mins for the manager to come back 'onto the floor' because apparently BANK_NAME staff are not allowed to leave their desks!! When I finally spoke to the manager he said they cannot listen to the call because my account is blocked. I now have to go into a branch with 3 bits of ID all because their member of staff incorrectly blocked my account. SHOCKING SERVICE, AVOID!! "
Customer_395," Unacceptable costumer service! Rude , helpless staff!!! "," Today I've had a really bad experience at one of their bank in Westfield , Stratford! I just wanted to put some cash money into my bank account, I was told by a member of staff to go to one machine. Me and my husband were waiting min.30-40 minutes, becaouse the queue was so long . In front of me was a gentleman who was trying for 10minutes to transfer money or I don't know what he exactly wanted, but no one helped him..and we were just waiting and waiting..until finally one lady from the staff arrived , but she wasn't to helpful and kind with him. When finally I was the next one I wanted to ask her to help me as well becouse it was the first time when I tryed to do it on the machine ,and I didn't wanted to keep staying all the people behind me while I guess who to do it. She was really , really rude! She told me Read the screen"" in front of everyone..but ok I just told her yes I read but I need help ..and she was ""No you didn't"" and I really don't understand how can she talk like this to a costumer! I asked her why is she so rude to me..and she was ""No I'm not rude "
Customer_396, barcleys did a valuation for our buyers when selling our home. before marketing we had three agents value it at 179k barcleys bank valuation said it was worth 160. how can they justify that!! ," The valuator that valued our home wasn't from the area and didn't know anything about the property. Or area he didn't even know it had a garage until I asked him if he'd looked in the garage when he was about to leave he was clearly incompitent. Now our buyers are struggling to raise the capital because they to think the property is worth 179. We renovated the property from the joists up with a brand new kitchen, boiler, roof, electrics, damp proofing and new bathroom , floors carpets and replastering. We basically rebuilt the house and the valuator didn't even bother to ask about this. BANK_NAME say you cant appeal unless its down valued by more than 25% but in this case legal parties will be investigating it plus were contacting watchdog and trading standards. "
Customer_397, Where do we start? ," Been banking with BANK_NAME for the last 7 years. Each and every month my company pays my wage in to my account. I have a miserable £10.00 overdraft, when I asked them weather this could be increased I got a NO as a straight answer. The lady I spoke to didn't even mention I could take an insurance package with them which should automatically bring my overdraft to £250.00.Tried to apply for a small finance option (less than £900) and applied to pay them back within the year.Nevertheless they did a hard search on my credit history, which of course lowered my score and didn't accept my request.Last year I kept getting bombarded by letters they send me to apply for their credit card. After the 10th letter stating we say yes to more and more people"" I applied and guess what"
Customer_398," If we were living in 1998 fantastic, but we're not and they aren't! ", Have a standard BANK_NAME current account and while the account itself if perfectly fine it has become unbelievably cumbersome to manage finances with BANK_NAME.I work in information security and consequently find immense benefits from a rooted android device; meaning I am unable to use the BANK_NAME app at all.As such I am required to carry around another device or visit a BANK_NAME cash point anytime I want to do something more involved with my account like a simple transfer to somebody new.  Every other bank manages to verify this without me having to leave the house - therefore there is nothing mobile about BANK_NAME mobile banking.Have been a customer for over 3 years hoping they may eventually catch up to times but unfortunately this doesn't seem likely anymore - I am moving my current account to another provider (I am aware Halifax offer truly mobile banking). 
Customer_399, Insurance ," Do not get any kind of insurance with BANK_NAME, waste of time and money. Sent them my damaged phone they charged me £50 and didn't even do a good job, it came back faulty and as good as worthless. a local phone repair shop could have done 100% better in less time with less professional equipment. Wouldn't even recommend joining BANK_NAME all together. I have 5 close family members who are with BANK_NAME and I've already convinced them to leave. Really not worth the acknowledgement of the staff or the bank itself, basically the bank is a joke and wouldn't be surprised if they go bankrupt in the next few years. "
Customer_4,When I call BANK_NAME I refuse to speak  ," When I call BANK_NAME I refuse to speak to any of the advisors in India for various reasons, so I always request to speak to a English call centre which they  dont mind putting me through.   However today I find out the UK call centres close between 9pm-10.30pm, I find this very strange, why do they close the UK call centres for 90 minutes at those times? Apparently its due to a staff changeover, Ive never ever heard this before."
Customer_40,Paid off my credit card in full before,"Paid off my credit card in full before the due date just before Christmas, but BANK_NAME kept the funds (£5000) and only posted it to the merchant company 3 months later! Caused be a world of pain and now my credit file has had a detrimental impact. Dealing with the issue now, so will be interested to hear if BANK_NAME will amend the error..."
Customer_400, terrible customer service unwilling to help and if you want to make any changes it would be easier achieve orbit on a tea soon , Totally useless 
Customer_401, Do you want to laugh at reading this? People at BANK_NAME are CRAZY. Don't waste your time and don't give them your money. ," I am a European Country citizen and I have recently moved to UK from a Western Country belonging to European Union, since I got a permanent and well paid job in a well known British Company. I tried to open a bank account at BANK_NAME in UK.I drop at the Branch in town, they tell me to fix an appointment and to bring my NIN and my passport.Once at the appointment, they tell me they cannot accept my NIN because it has my previous address on it and to get an updated one. I get it, fix an appointment again. Once there, they tell me that they cannot accept this document because THE RULES HAVE CHANGED. They ask me to produce an account statement from a foreign Bank account, with my present address on it. I update this information on my foreign account through the online banking, I print it and I deliver it to BANK_NAME. They tell me they cannot accept it because it is produced via internet and THEY WANT TO SEE THE STAMPS to prove it is original.Therefore, since the Company I work for is present on their database of acceptable and trusted Companies, they ask me to produce a reference letter written by any Company's Official, stating that I am on a permanent contract and my present address. I get a reference letter written by the Human Resources Manager, complying with all the requirements listed on the note they gave me, and I bring it to BANK_NAME. They tell me they cannot accept it because THE PAPER IS TOO THIN and that the words permanent contract"" and my address shall be PLACED ON A DIFFERENT POINT OF THE SHEET.Astounded"
Customer_402, disgusting , I put my visa debit card into the cash machine along with my pin number and the amount I wanted to draw out. After a while it gabe me my card and recipt  but no cash. I went into the bank explained that I am disabled and what  had  just happend   first of all they said they cant do anything for 24  hours then they said 12  days till my claim went thru. Just because they said they cant refund me 
Customer_403, Unprofessionals ," Unprofessionals, the stuff are like robots. The ansewers are the same for everything. If they do not know what to do they just apologise and do nothing. If they can avoid to do an extra step in order to help you they will gladly take the chance. "
Customer_404, Terrible phone service , Wouldn't have even given it one star if it was an option. Spoke to them a week ago and was told I would get a phone call back later on in the day that never happened... a week later I'm calling again and have been stuck on hold for over an hour. Don't expect this from such a large bank. 
Customer_405, Excellent service ," Excellent service at Sheffield Pitstone Street.  All senior and junior members of staff dealt with my query so efficently, exemplary customer service. "
Customer_406, 3 weeks wait to open an account. , It doesn't bode well if it takes a wait of three weeks for a bank just to open an account... 
Customer_407, Unhelpful rude never banking with them again , I opened my account on the 21/1/17 On the 30/1/17 I got this texts Your BANK_NAME Debit Card has been temporarily deactivated to prevent fraudulent activity. I called the number they couldn't tell me what's going on !!! I said I need my money to pay the rent I was told to go into a bank and I could access my account. Got to the bank couldn't get any money out. My account had been frozen ! I needed to send proof that the money is mine. I did that in a email I've receive nothing back ! I've sent a letter too. Then I got a letter dated for the 30th January saying my account is being closed and I have to get the money out ect I got this letter on the 3rd of February I've spend around 12 hours on the phone 90% of the time on hold. The staff are rude and have no idea what is going on. I'm still waiting on information about my account. Where has my money gone ! 
Customer_408, Incompetent , I'm still on hold to a call centre in India and have been for over one hour. I can't afford to hang up as they have messed up my direct debit for my mortgage. I'll need a mortgage to cover the 'phone call!!I've been a customer for 43 years- it all started to go wrong when they reduced staff in branches to which you had direct accessibility. Absolutely appalling 
Customer_409, PREMIER *anking ," I cannot believe a supposedly professional company can operate with this amount of negativity.I would feel ashamed to work for this shower.The name needs to be changed to INFERIOR Banking or something that reflects the service we seem to be getting.Catherine, Tanya and Vicky and all of the other people who tried to sort my problem out, your company, its telephone system and working procedures..................... ARE A JOKE....!!!!!! "
Customer_41,Wow what disgusting service,"Wow what disgusting service, I went to put my wife s money into the bank in hoole chester for her as she is self employed and not very well and the bank would not let me do it, I have always done it for her before but the bank told me to put it into my own bank and transfer it over to her, what is the point in having a branch the lady was rude and not helpfull, I will be bringing my wife over to my bank BANK_NAME."
Customer_410, The most appalling service I received in my entire life. (hands down) ," Most appalling customer service I have received in my entire life. @SheffieldPinstoneStreet (with 2.9 google review score)First my data sensitive information was sent to a wrong address and no one could tell me where. This was a result of someone not updating my home address correctly which you would think it is imperative a bank employee to get that right.As a result of this of this I also almost missed the date of my visa application.  Just last week a trainee left unsupervised blocked my card before i confirmed it was OK and a request for a new one to be re-issued was never made until I got back in touch today.They also can't send my card with a next day delivery to rectify their atrocious service plus even though I asked to be transferred to complaints team, I was hang up on. I have no words. I am closing my account as soon as I get a new card from a different bank! "
Customer_411, Worst bank ever. Steer clear , Bank in dark ages. Takes ages on phone to do anything with them. Staff absolutely useless in branch. Stay clear at all costs. 
Customer_412, Unacceptable ," I made a payment to a wrong account . I had a look on BANK_NAME website to what can I do . They advise to call customer service did they told me I need to go to my local branch . In the branch had to wait 45mins to tell me they cant deal with my problem as they extremely busy . In the 45 mins I saw at least 3-4 staff walking around doing nothing . I have my account with BANK_NAME more then 5 years I think its time to cancel it .Just got my new debit card from another better bank . Thank you BANK_NAME for the great"" help . """

Customer_414, Poor service , Shockingly poor service in branch. No counter staff in Wakefield trinity walk branch 
Customer_415, telephone banking fraud , fraud reported 09/01/17 - 21st jan today still can't get through to speak to anyone. two hours waiting in a queue until the battery dies on my phone. absolutely abysmal service. shocking! 
Customer_416, Chat support is very unrealiable ," They sent my replacement card to incomplete address despite confirming it 3 times beforehand whilst updating my address on chat and placing new card order. I had to place 2 card orders total and it took over 3 weeks for my new card to arrive.  Misinformed me about expected card delivery time abroad. They have quite a good response time on chat support though. Customer experience at my local branch has always been very good, as opposed to chat support. "
Customer_417, Jill Mumford at the Mortgage Call Centre - Rude , Just spoke to Jill on the phone reference getting a mortgage appointment.  Despite us being first time buyers she was sighing and clearly irritated if we didnt know the answer to stuff on the phone.  Get somebody more personable on the phone please BANK_NAME. 
Customer_418, 6 week wait before appointment to open account! , Talk about letting young people down. Without an account they cannot work in a legit job. BANK_NAME want them to delay their job applications until they have time to open you an account. on 19/01.2017 I was told she had to wait until 9th March as that was the first date available when an account could be opened!!!!!!!!!!!Still run like a 1960's post office in JamaicaBet they will start late opening and half day closing soon!!! 
Customer_419, Worst bank ever , Went in the Lincoln branch to open my 12 year old daughter an account. The man downstairs said he'd added her name to the waiting list and to go upstairs and wait and someone would open an account for her.  I'm disabled so was a bit of a pain but I agreed as she wants her own account. After waiting upstairs for someone to become free he came over and said we didn't have an appointment so would have to make one and come back again! I asked him why we'd been put to the hassle of waiting upstairs for nothing he answered good question! He then told me to go to the Halifax and open an account instead. Very impressive customer service I must say and obviously the reputation BANK_NAME had years ago has not changed one bit. 
Customer_42,Really poor,Really poor - rewards app is particularly bad. Do not use this Bank.
Customer_420, 'Sorry' not in their lexicon ," My friend reported her debit card lost and received a replacement. She later noticed a nightclub charge - she has children and grandchildren - BANK_NAME refunded her but would not apologise for not cancelling.  Yet BANK_NAME Credit Card said 'Contactless is cancelled automatically when reported lost or stolen'. I got the Ombudsman in, BANK_NAME gave inane reasons, no apology and £25 compensation. What a cowboy outfit...Even then they forgot their agreement and after 7 weeks it needed another contact with the Ombudsman to process this payment.They have 'lost' the payment made by this same customer to her energy supplier, resulting in a collection agency contacting her.If they took as much trouble looking after customers as they do their managers and upper-level staff... "
Customer_421, Awful ," Dreadful, mockery, sham of a company, p I s s poor truly. "
Customer_422, cannot get through to them ," cannot get through to a human, have been trying for days. they have ruined my credit score by not updating the fact my card was paid off. "
Customer_423, Meltdown at BANK_NAME Complaints Department: not even the CEO can get anything done ," BANK_NAME scores consistently at the bottom of the league tables for customer satisfaction. This accords with my own experience, one of utter frustration in trying to get them to do a simple transaction and then in owning up to this deficiencies. Not even contacting the CEO has rectified the problem, for he seems unable to order his executive team to get anything done. Clearly BANK_NAME shareholders are getting real value from his £8m+ (2015 figure) salary.I will continue to make postings on this dreadful bank until I get satisfaction.Professor R Middleton "
Customer_424, Horrible thieves! , Horrible thieves! 
Customer_425, Atrocious Customer Service , Just received a letter from BANK_NAME talking about changes to Terms & Conditions which are outlined in a booklet which I have to collect from a branch. Why was it not enclosed with the letter I ask myself. Called BANK_NAME to ask them to send it but they won't do this!!! Why? Do customers really have to do all the leg work?? Come on BANK_NAME if you want to tell me about changes to my T's & C's just include the information you are referring to. I really don't want to have to take this to the Ombudsman. 
Customer_426, I want to leave minus star actually!! ," I had an appointment,when i get there on time,they said the staff is not in today! Never heard of such thing before,a bank staff treat customers appointment like that! Then the customer service bring me to another assistant who said i cant help you,you have to ring them! I rang them then,after about half an hour waiting and explaining and security check and telling them what i need over the phone then they said i have to come to branch. Feel like im a ball being kicked around by them!I go to HSBC straight away,i swear im gonna closed  all my BANK_NAME account and never use them again! "
Customer_427, I have never regretted doing business with a place as much. , Banking with BANK_NAME has ruined my credit score and caused me to have so much unnecessary debt. When you try to clear your debt or get them to fix their errors the push you to go throught debt management companies. I can't wait to close my account with them. 
Customer_428, Damage to Credit Score , Please be warned that even if you are not their customer they will perform searches on your credit file and damage your score as they can't be bothered to do proper checks to prevent fraud. Their fraud investigation team is complete shambles.I will have nothing to do with this disgraceful company. 
Customer_429, treated me well and done a great job , personal accounts and business accounts they have always looked after me 
Customer_43,The worst Bank,The worst Bank! Especially for business banking don't bank with them! I've never been soo angry at thier incompetence
Customer_430, Poor customer service ," I received a closure account notice. I have identified this as identity theft as I have no account with BANK_NAME. Tried to contact the fraud team and there was up to one hour waiting time.   I tried to call 5 times but to no avail.  I went into Hounslow High Street branch and they were useless as well. The uninterested staff dialled the same number as I dialled and left me to wait for the phone to be answered whilst he served other customers.   1 hour and 10 minutes on hold I gave up. Left the branch disgusted as within that one hr the guy never even came back to me just to check.  I also asked him how easy it is to open an account with banks. He said it was not and that the account this thief had made had been closed. So why generate a bank account number and sort code if it was not opened in the first place? And why despite of recognising this is a fraud hence they closed the account did this impact my credit score?  Also on one side they have about 3 chairs and tablets and on the wall it said, it takes minutes to open an account.""  So it means it is easy to open an account and yet they spend so much time dealing with fraud claims because of no one else's fault but them. They are actually encouraging criminals to do just that. """
Customer_431, Worst Company I Have Dealt With ," I had a payment declined on my card earlier today and a text was sent to advise me of the fact, I responded that the purchase was genuine as requested. I called the company and the card was put through again but once again declined. I telephoned BANK_NAMEcard and they confirmed payment had been made. In trying to sort out who was in fact telling the truth I called BANK_NAMEcard a further three times, going through security five times, left queuing for an hour in total finally to be told they could (or would) do nothing. Overcoming the linguistics of Mumbai, well that is another story. "
Customer_432, Being treated like a villain ," I have a friend who is very hard of hearing and he needed to know the balance on his account and query the recent transactions, so I telephoned the bank for him whilst he stood beside me.  They were O.K., but we gave up because my friend couldn't hear well enough to answer all the questions.  I popped into the branch to pay some money into his account, but had forgotten to bring in his debit card.  I apologized to the Cashier that I had not brought his card in and could not remember his account number, but explained that I knew his address and post code and advised that his account was at that branch, so that was the sort code side of it sorted.  The lady refused to take the money that I wanted to pay into his account, even though I stressed that I knew his balance (which I also quoted) and that the money needed to go in to bring the account back into credit because he would incurr further charges if the money didn't go in.  The Cashier looked at me in disgust, as if to imply that I was 'in the wrong' and that she clearly dis-approved of this.  I had done nothing wrong, but was being treated like I was causing trouble.  I advised that this was not acceptable service and asked to speak to the Manager.  I was asked to take a seat and wait to see a Manager, which was not a problem and then I was summonsed into a private room.  This was O.K. because, at least, they were good enough to give me their time, so credit to them on that score,  but when I repeated myself again; stressing that all I wanted to do was pay cash into my friend's account to put his account in credit (waving the cash, as I said this, to prove that I was not a villain!), and I had his name, address and post code and even had his date of birth, if necessary, she explained that their computers were programmed to stop them taking payments without the account number too.  I complained that this was not a problem with other banks and had not been a problem before when I'd paid money into another branch of BANK_NAME.  The Manager of the Wroxham branch, Joanne, tried to insist that it would have been a problem at another branch and, in fact, with other banks.  This was not true.  All she could advise was that it was to do with data protection, which did not convince me, since I was not asking for any of his credentials and, if anything, how is it protecting the customer when they are asking me to get his personal account number?!; surely, that's encouraging me to steal his credentials and can increase the temptation for identity theft?!, so that didn't convince me, so I asked her for this excuse in writing.  Being complacent, conceited and feeling that she was better than others, she refused to give anything in writing.  She was quite unpleasant at this point.  Maybe I'd 'took the wind from her sails'.She kept insisting that the branch would not take the money, even though I had his credentials, then asked if I banked with BANK_NAME, which was irrelevant.  Understandably, at that point, I was angry because they would continue to charge him daily for being overdrawn and I responded 'Did I f.....' and that I did 'not give a s.... about BANK_NAME'.  At that same moment, I got up to leave, as the conversation was over and I'd vented my anger.   At no point was I aggressive or abusive towards her or any member of staff, for that matter.  As I gestured to get the door handle to open the door, she too stood up to open it for me to let me out.  Now, remember that it was myself that had got up to leave, yet as I walked out of the little room into the central customer area of thebranch, where the rest of the staff were - hungrily looking on for drama, I hasten to add (and this was not my imagination) she said to my back, as I walked across the open area of the branch towards the exit 'Now, I'd like you to leave the branch....'., trying to show off to the other serving staff members on the floor, as if to imply that She was telling Me to go!, to make herself look big and powerful, when that Was Not the case at all!  She irritated me further at that point because she was deliberately berating me, in an attempt, perhaps, to give her the satisfaction of my entertaining other staff members with a volatile response from me, so  I calmly replied that I was glad to leave and calmly walked out, but she then said, again to my back, as I walked off (as she'd managed to bring in her captive audience of staff and customers) 'I'm not being spoken to like that.'  This was purely to boost her own ego and imply to the others that I'd been abusive to her.  She knew, very well, that I did not verbally abuse her and should have used her common sense and professionalism to remain tactful and graciously see me out of the door, maybe with a polite apology because she knew my language was a gesture of anger at the bank and not her, but she was so complacent, she took the opportunity to villainize me for her image.  That's NOT the way to treat, decent people, who do not anger or swear easily and are, in fact, a credit to society. "
Customer_433, Stupid entry policies. They don't a … ," Stupid entry policies. They don't accept NHS letters, Student Loan Company letters, pay-slips, nothing that a 20 years old teenager can have. I mean do they really expect me to pay housing bills when I'm a full time student? Went to branch 4 times for opening an account but apparently there is something missing every time, even tho I took every single document with me, even the unnecessary ones. Joined to BANK_NAME EASILY on the first try and I'm really happy with them. "
Customer_434, Why did I bother? ," Ive banked with BANK_NAME since the '60's and my wife is an ex employee. They used to be unbeatable for customer care until they decided that customers no longer mattered to them and they got rid of their customer oriented staff about 20+ years ago, since then they have deteriorated out of all recognition. Foreign CS staff - Ive nothing against them, but at least make sure they can speak understandable English! what was wrong with the ones they sacked?I think the least said about them the better.Have you tried to pay in a cheque these days? I tried in two branches - both with mile long queues and only one or two cashiers handling everything under the sun except banking. What has this country sunk to. "
Customer_435, Ridiculous bank ," I joined BANK_NAME a year ago after my friends recommended it and I wanted a fresh bank account after getting married. I have had nothing but problems with them. Whenever I pay for anything with my card either online or in person, they block it. You then ring up confirm it's you and get sent a new bank card. I have been with them for 18 months and have had 9 bank cards with them because they are constantly blocking it whenever I try to buy anything or withdraw money because it is flagged as fraudulent. My rent is  month it declines my lament, I have to ring up and confirm it's me. The only way I can pay my rent is with two 200 transaction one after the over to the exact same company so instead of detecting to identical payments as errors they detect one single payment as fraudulent. They're ridiculous. The final straw is tonight they have blocked me from my account in their words to protect the bank, because I didn't sound like myself on the phone. Even though I passed all my security questions, they said I need to go into branch with two forms of ID to confirm it's me it is absolutely ridiculous all the fkng about I have to do every single month with this bank. It's the final straw now! I am leaving them and going to a decent bank . Please avoid at all costs you will have nothing but trouble with them. "
Customer_436, BANK_NAME needs to drastically impro … ," BANK_NAME needs to drastically improve their Customer care. My Mother recently died she had 2 accounts with BANK_NAME, despite my sister & myself taking all the necessary paperwork into the local branch where Mom banked we had heard nothing after 5 weeks.

I transfer about £500 monthly and by the end of the month I am usually left at about £100. From their perspective i cannot / should not be considered as a safe credit customer. They straight away offered direct debit services such as insurance of all sorts and offered me a loan of £20,000. They did not even mention the interest rates. I had to refuse the offer several times in order to make it clear that i do not require a loan and that i came in just to notify them of change of my address. "

Customer_443, Sweetness and light when they want your money - till they have to return it. ," My stepfather had an investment account with BANK_NAME Wealth in Jersey for decades - at least 30 years. He died in April 2015. My executor was told by BANK_NAME that only English probate was required to release the funds. That was obtained, only to be told that Jersey probate was also required. A request for an explanation as to why we now need Jersey probate ( which will result in extra costs and delays) has not even been replied to, after a month. The contempt with which the banks treat us when they have to give us something back has not changed one iota since 2008. I'm anti-Brexit, but if it means the City goes abroad - good riddance. Parasites. "

Went through many security questions and was asked if I had made any recent transactions.

When I asked for an explanation the person on the phone said Sorry it's a bad line you are breaking up"" and the phone went dead! I gave up hope as by this time I'd spent over 2 hours trying.

This once was no exception"
Customer_447," Unacceptable, unhelpful "," I've banked with BANK_NAME for 30 years and every time I need to call them I wish I didn't.This applies to current, savings, business and credit card accounts.  Just lucky I don't have a mortgage with them too.Customer services can always find a way to ensure you never get exactly what you need from being unable to pay full balances, to being unable to update addresses, to getting me on telephone banking so I can do these things, to calling back when they promise to or getting things done on time.I reported fraudulent activity on my card for thousands of pounds and they even made that so difficult that I never got the money back.To put it bluntly - they suck. At banking, at customer service, at being helpful, at  being efficient. Pretty much everything. One by one I've moved my money and my families money elsewhere - because if there is a way to mess things up for you (whilst charging you for it in the process) BANK_NAME will find a way.Avoid like the plague - your money would be safer in a tin can than with these jokers.

Customer_448, SHOCKING !!! RUINED MY CHRISTMAS ," On the 10th of November I paid my gas and electricity bill via card payment. My supplier informed me the bill was paid on this day and I owed nothing. I was utterly shocked to discover this morning that I was overdrawn on my account and BANK_NAME have left me with -2.22. I contacted them immediately to be told that they had transfered the gas and electricity money back into my account on the 17th November without informing me this was happening. Now I have no direct debits and I certainly didn't notice that the bill money was paid back into my account. I don't constantly check my balance as BANK_NAME text my balance on a Friday evening. So my weekly balance never made me think I had anymore or any less in my account so always seem correct according to what I've spent.According to my bank the gas and electricity supplier didn't take the money on the 10th even though my supplier has confirmed they did, they have taken the money from my account over a month later and now a week before Christmas I have nothing.What money I had left in the account was travel for work and Christmas food.Not once was I informed that a major company southern electricity hadn't taken the payment for my bill. Which I find extremely bizarre as I was under the impression that when a payment is made it will be debited from my account and can take 3 working days for the company to see this on my account with them.My supplier has confirmed it was cleared on the day I paid this bill. So customer service complete waste of time at BANK_NAME informs me the supplier had 3 to 10 days to collect the money then to be told 15 days from my account to then be told 7 days from my account and BANK_NAME then put the money back into my account confused yet oh it gets better .....So according to BANK_NAME they put the bill money back into my account on the 17th November because this major company hasn't collected the bill payment and not once was I informed. so my situation I was not aware this money was credited back to my account it didn't flag up on my balance but a month down the line this company has now asked for this payment and I now have nothing for Christmas. I have no issues paying my bills it's important but what the hell is BANK_NAME playing at??? I authorised a payment on the 10th November I have not instructed my bank to take any payment after this so what's all this 7 days nonsense about the bank have messed up not me and now I'm being punished !!!! Why the hell was I not informed of this it's not my fault I demanded them put the payment back into my account but apparently they can't do this! at least I could then have some payment plan for there cock up happy Christmas BANK_NAME !!!!

Customer_45,This review will not lead anywhere,"This review will not lead anywhere because nobody will read from the FCA. Anyway you should know that BANK_NAME Bank UK is a lobby which is free to abuse and destroy people business not having anybody controlling their bank s dirty business. If you complaint after that they made you loose money and business, they just simply close your accounts without any explanation. It s a lobby , worse than every other criminal organisation out of control. Somebody relevant should look into this. Nobody will do I am sure. Ombudsman does work at all, they are all together. Rules must change or they need to close this bank. They just destroy a banking UK traditions."
Customer_450, Expect the worst and receive it! ," So, I have not had any online banking since 2014, Despite endless hours spend running up my phone bill and feckless staff in branch, which now has got rid off nearly all staff in favour of 6 computerised bank machines (this in a City of all places!) now populated by 2 confused members of staff and older people milling about wondering why their bank has been closed down in all but name,I have complained about lack of access to internet banking but after last 'escalation' which resulted in team sending me mocking letter and 60 refund which has not covered cost of phone calls I have now given up and set up an account with another bank,On one occasion I rang the internet banking team in desperation whilst travelling and needing to log in and transfer money in an emergency, the member of staff kept telling me to press keys on keyboard which I know don't do anything and every time I did this the banking 'team' were applauding and clapping in background clearly as some form of sport,I have been a BANK_NAME customer since a child and remained loyal long after I should have,You are the worst kind of scum, and don't deserve my business,The loathing I now have for you is only equalled by my desire to change banks "

BT acknowledged that they were fraudulent in raising these charges against me and rescinded the charges.Despite this, BT have charged me and BANK_NAME accepted the charges.BANK_NAME are a disgrace to the banking sector and I intend moving my account and leaving my comments on all the social media sites I can find.

Diabolical attitude. Thought she was Prescilla Queen of The Desert. Cut me off half way through speaking and looked the other way. Never had such a rude experience in my life. Your customers have money invested in you.Tomorrow they might not have. Work on staff attitude. Indian call centre is generally a lot better with customer interaction.

Customer_455, Incredibly poor customer service ," BANK_NAME customer service online banking has become the worst customer service. They talk to the customers like computers and have no sense of flexibility and understanding not even in relation of an injured person. The fraud dept accidentally blocked my card without warning. i'd previously explained that the transaction made was fine. The fraud dept said they took note of that and everything was fine and sorted. Out of the blue, they cancel my card while injured (can't walk) and in need of food shopping. They told me to go to the bank and sort it out there! It seems British institutions nowadays act like computers with no empathy and no understanding of the customers' needs and situations even in case of illness and injury. "
Customer_456," They are rude and intrusive into personal circumstances"" """," I went to my local branch, in Devizes, where I have had an account for over 50 years. I wanted to transfer money from one account to another (a transaction I often do) I had my bank statement with me, as usual. The teller whom I've never seen before would not do the transaction as I had no form of identity. I was only transferring money & if she had bothered to look it up she would have seen the 2 accounts. Anyway she said come back with your bank card which I did - another round trip of 10 miles - she then asked me if I owned my house! This in front of other people & is of no concern of hers. In all an unpleasant experience & if it wasn't too complicated I would have cancelled my accounts with them immediately. "
Customer_457, The worst customer service ever experienced! ," Everyone one comes into contact with through customer service at BANK_NAME are incompetent, rude, and quite frankly useless. They lack expertise on anything and everything you need help with and they are extremely poor in their ability to service and handle their customers. The waiting time to get through to customers service is seldom less than 30 minutes at which point they tell you someone else will have to call you back because they know nothing about the subject you are calling about. They are careless about your personal data and details and are quite frankly the worst bank I have ever banked with. I am switching all of my banking to another bank, I have had enough of BANK_NAME and I would warn anyone and everyone I know from banking with BANK_NAME. It's a disgrace. "
Customer_458, Switched my account over and shut it down... , All my money went in a BANK_NAME new account. Received my cards and PIN number and internet banking details arrived.

No funds to feed my kids or pay my bills and do the Christmas shopping. OMG. 
Customer_459," Terrible Customer Service, They block your account for no reason whenever they want "," This bank is ridiculous. They block your account whenever they want and you the customer will end up in bad credit because you wouldn't be able to pay your bills. If you give them a call the customer service is extremely awful, they have no idea what they are talking about. The FCA should close this worthless incompetent bank. Guess what I am moving not only my bank but I am advising any family or friend I know to close their accounts immediately and move to better banks. "

Customer_461, WORSE BANK EVER ," I have been banking with BANK_NAME since 2005, recently I have noticed that they are becoming untrustworthy and I am strongly considering moving to another bank. I transferred £400 from my account to my girlfriends account. The money was debited on my account but the recipient never received it. I phoned BANK_NAME, the confirmed that my girlfriend’s account was rightly entered on the system by me but they seem not to be able to trace where they sent my money to.  The customers service was awfully unbelievably appalling. They kept me on the phone for over an hour only to tell me that if the money is lost they will try to trace it and see if they can recover it. I was expecting them to refund me as the mistake was from their end and not from me. My girlfriend needed the money to pay for her flight, as a result of BANK_NAME mistake she had to miss out travelling with her best friends. As I am typing this now they still haven’t refunded my money nor traced where they sent my money to. If you are considering open an account, please stay away from BANK_NAME "
Customer_462, BANK_NAME Fraud ," Had fraud on my Debit Card totalling £370 spent through River Island.Was initially refunded the money until two weeks later I had to sign a form saying the transactions were fraudulent.Called up BANK_NAME as the money was once again taken from my account. Was informed that the transactions were deemed as legitimate because I had purchased from River Island legitimately in the past. Was fobbed off on the phone, constantly being told that the fraud team have clearly said that the transactions were legitimate.Contacted River Island and was informed that the bank had not even contacted them to query the transactions.So BANK_NAME can somehow deem fraud to be legitimate simply because I had purchased from River Island in the past.I am now waiting for a response from a Manager after putting in a complaint "
Customer_463, Useless ," BANK_NAME Bank have got to be 1 of the worst banks ever!!! Their customer service team are absolutely useless, training in this company must be nonexistent!!!! Not once have I ever had my situation resolved or anyone on the other end sounding slightly interested in doing so!! They are rude and intrusive into personal circumstances, if I had a choice I would most definitely not bank with them!! Frustrated and angry yet again to my requests not being met satisfactory!!! "
Customer_464, Shi**y bank shi**y customer service ," BANK_NAME is the worst bank, their customer service team are rude and dnt know what they're tlking about.

Avoid! Communication in the company is awful! "
Customer_466, BANK_NAME manager at Kingsland branch discriminatory against disabled customers ," I am a disabled person who walks with a cruch and have asthma and heart problems.Although I was not well I had to make a payment with cash. I went to Kingsland Branch to pay Card account.  As I am disabled I was told to stand on the side of the questions and when a counter becomes available the cashier would call me. I have been doing this way since I was told by the staff at Kingsland Branch London. As I only had till 21st of this month to pay and I could not go until today dye to breathing problems. I went and stood by the place where I was told to wait on the side of the que. To my astonishment the cashier pointed at me and said go to the back of the que and tell the last person to safe my place in the que and when my turn comes I would be seen. I replied this is what I was told by staff before. The cashier stated that the new manager have withdrawn this assistance and we cannot no longer accomodate in this way. Further to this I was told find a sitting place. I walked away in disgust and could not believe that a bank manager could be so cruel on disabled people that she has made it her policy to discriminate against disabled people.  As I was leaving the bank I seen a member of staff standing. I asked him if I he could tell me the managers name. He gave me the name and I asked him why has the policy of disabled people asistance changed. He replied this is what the manager has stated. I asked him is this the policy if BANK_NAME,  he replies maybe. I stated to him that if this is the case i am very sure that the discrimination disability act is being broken. He stated what is that. When he stated that I felt it would be pointless to talk to a person who didn't even know that a law existed  to discriminate against disabled people. I requested if I could see the manager for a minute as I stated I feel I and many other disabled people are being discriminate due to disability/ health issues. Without finding out he said you may have to wait a while. As my breathing was becoming a problem,  I stated that I will contact BANK_NAME by phone and see whether BANK_NAME have a policy which discriminates against disabled people or not and also I am going to make an official complaint against BANK_NAME Kingsland Branch for discriminating against disabled people. I called BANK_NAME and talked to a customer service personnel by the name of steve. He went through security questions and asked how I could be assisted today. I told him what happened. He was disgusted in the way I was treated and said if my father was treated like yourself I would not put up with this type of customer service from BANK_NAME although I am working for BANK_NAME. Due to this now I am delayed in paying my card account. He stated that until this matter is resolved he would put on the notes that a late payment on my card would not trigger a late paying fine. He also escalated the matter  and gave me the relevant timescales of when this issue will be investigated and hopefully resolved. I feel to be ill and disabled is becoming a crime. Have we lost all of our senses. A Manager pushing discriminatory policies should be moved from her post and given maybe a job away from public services. It's people like her in the posistion of authority abusing her posistion and I would call this institutional abuse as she is a manager. I request BANK_NAME to immediately remove her from her position. Also to Clear sign showing disabled, a priority disabled cashier desk,  like they have for business banking. If these tasks are not done I feel BANK_NAME is no longer for me. SHAME SHAME SHAME YOU MANAGER OF KINGSLAND ROAD BRANCH LONDON. Remember my words maybe you may become disabled and ill one day. What will happen to you, you should ask this question to your self so maybe you change now. "
Customer_467," Don't care at all that they're making poor people poorer, but really pretend to care, which is just creepy "," BANK_NAME contacted me on Nov advising me my account was being migrated"". What this actually meant is my interest free overdraft was about to change to one where I would pay a few pounds every day I was in it.They gave me 2 months to get my affairs in order"
Customer_468, Financially Ruined Me ," Gave me a graduate overdraft account of £1,500 interest free for up to a year, followed by an interest free limit of £1,000 the year after. Sent a generic letter advising 'graduate accounts are changing'. Called up to ask what that meant to me - advised my limit would go from £1,500 to £1,000 as it should after a year. Also advised that due to the changes, my limit would be increased to £2,000 as per the 'changes'. I was informed incorrectly. Turns out it doesn't change. So no I have no money to eat, or pay for my depression medication. I contacted FOS who are trying to help. Unlike BANK_NAME who just keep saying 'they're looking into it'. I work in a high end insurance company. If one of my clients was advised wrongly of cover, that would be classed as a breach and we would make sure that client is in no worse position than they should be at any point.Again, unlike BANK_NAME who don't seem to give a toss if their customers can't afford to eat due to their mistake.

Customer_479, worse company ever ," i have to call for the third time to request for my pin, and the customer service personnel asked me questions which i  provided aside my 16 digit numbers because of security reasons.i preferred typing it on my phone.i was surprise to hear from matteo that their system does not allow numbers to be typed, you always have to mention it.meaning customers security concerns are not of importance.i requested to speak to his manager which took me 10 mins on hold, and i presume the lady i spoke to was a colleague not a manager.This lady you can tell was already angry on the phone with me after listening to her colleague.she confirmed the same company's procedures that they cant help without the 16 digit numbers and the system doesn't allow it to be typed.so i raised a concern that, due to customers security issues, their system needs an upgrade to help customers type in their information than to mention it.she said boldly it cant be done.i then said if they cant help,i want to know why i haven't received my pin to date.this lady asked me to contact Royal mail since they have sent it. it is my responsibility  to contact Royal mail for my pin.i asked her twice because i knew this was a wrong information.firstly i haven't received a note from royal mail to contact them for not meeting me or anything.And she was able to tell me they have done their part by sending it.so i have to contact royal mail.seriously i have never heard this anywhere if not BANK_NAME. very very very poor customer service ever.i am thinking of switching already.

Customer_48,BANK_NAME think they are my mother controlling me and my money AVOID,"BANK_NAME think they are my mother. Controlling me and my money.  Blocking online payments without good reason.  'We change the parameters daily' is no comfort to me when I cannot pay for goods and services.  I have banked with them since 1995, had NO problems until last year.  Firstly they lost 7 months of statements.  The lack of correct English speaking Indians at the call centre drove me mad saying 'It is in de cloud'  when it was not.  I spent 4 hours in the bank in person, they said they had ordered the statements - and India sent the wrong ones.  In the end they had to microfiche the correct ones for me to use in my accounts. I complained to the Banking Ombudsman and got absolutely nowhere.  They continue to block my debit card online payments, which makes me look like I do not have the money to pay.  So if you are looking for a bank that is helpful, a problem-solver - not problem maker DO NOT PICK BANK_NAME. E-mail gets no replies, writing gets eventually replied to.   Phone calls are hell if you get through to India.  Text messages are constantly annoying.  WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE! It's my money and they are in beach of contract."
Customer_480, WORST BANK EVER , I Would rather stash my money under my bed than bank with BANK_NAME. Horrible service. Take my advice and don't bother with them. 
Customer_481, Still waiting for a debit card , Opened a bank account less than a month ago. First debit card never came in the mail. Called customer service and was instructed to go in-branch to print a new debit card. I go in branch and they tell me they can't do that since my account is less than a month old (did the person on the phone not know that?). They cancel my first debit card and send a second one through the mail. They say it's gonna take 5 working days but I'm still waiting for this debit card as well. Horrible bank. 
Customer_482, The WORST UK Bank- not sure why are they still in business ," I just signed up with BANK_NAME and I've only had negative experience with them so far. Their Indian call centre is pathetic and unprofessional! They are rude, unhelpful and just don't underhand customers frustration. I had a credit card with them and closed it immediately based on my initial experience with them.  I've filed a complaint and still receive the worst banking experience. This is coming from someone who has banked with Halifax Santander HSBC. I will never Bank with BANK_NAME again!! Not worth my time or money. Go somewhere else! Don't waste your time "
Customer_483, new online banking app poor. ," New app not as good as old. Difficult to navigate, the information is not as clear. No running balance with statement. No actual balance and available one so not certain if funds have cleared. Very clunky . Bring back the old version. "
Customer_484, personal loan for long term disability claimant ," booked appointment on phone regarding personal loan,visited branch and met advisor, wasnt in the chair 5 minutes before being told no chance dispite having a regular income of 10k a year , recovering cancer patient getting pip payment ,wasted journey could and should have been avoided if telephone call had explained to me ,they had all the info they needed to assess me ,i feel they are prejudice towards people in same situation as me despite being told that as long as i had regular income i would be treated as anyone else "
Customer_485, Lied about the terms of a loan ," I took a business loan from BANK_NAME, but they lied about the terms of it. Now they've ruined my business and are setting about ruining me financially.Stay well away. "
Customer_486, appalling service! ," worst bank experience ever in my whole life. today my card got deactivated by BANK_NAME because they sent me a new one which I didn't receive because had been sent out TODAY too. i mean, seriously?  how on earth am i supposed to get my new card today if u sent it today, and how dare they to block my card the same day my new one ha been sent? tomorrow i am flying abroad for my holidays, and someone through the customer service said that they might be able to help me at any branch tomorrow morning.. well they better, and what if my flight was tonight? i think it's time to change bank. "
Customer_487, I would love to give no or negative start if I have the choice ," BANK_NAME online banking helping center with email or telephone are playing ball games, they tell you to contact by the other way, but never can sort out any problem. Plus their account manager are the most useless roles, they can not answer any directly question and help their business customer with any single issue, they keep referring us back to call the customer help line! The account manager we had is ''Vanessa Lee'' if this is a genuine person, not their Indian call center using made up names! This bank is a joke! "
Customer_488, OMG worst ever telephone banking service , The worst telephone banking customer service I have ever suffered.  It took over 30 minutes to speak to someone with enough command of English to send me a password reset for my mortgage account. I opened the account years ago  with ING who were outstanding. BANK_NAME's what have you done?NG 
Customer_489, Appaling customer services ," The Indian call centre tries to help, but are completely useless. Some of the conversations are even comical because they are so clueless. "
Customer_49,This company is impossible to deal with,This company is impossible to deal with at any level. Applied for mortgage and after 6 months they turned it down. They kept loosing paperwork and asking for information time after time. One month later took money out of bank on DD.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
Customer_490, Possible the worst online banking system in the world ," If I could have scored a minus figure I would. Call centre staff on their 0330 helpline do not know what they are doing, online system unusable, waiting time to speak to helpline unacceptable, international payments, that went through ok on BIB, will not go through on .Net. All in all, terrible "
Customer_491, Amused ," I am amused by my interactions with BANK_NAME. We only have a mortgage with them as it was taken out with Woolwich so now falls under BANK_NAME (sadly). We are HSBC Premier, Amex Platinum etc customers. My two interactions with BANK_NAME to simply get access to an online mortgage account have encouraged me to believe I will never take any products with this company. - Indian call centre has no idea what they are doing - may I place you on hold while I look into that sir?"" Read - I have no idea how to do that so am asking someone or looking it up in the manual!- I will now transfer you to someone in mortgage services"" - read someone who speaks and understands English and should be better trained so can answer your question (Liverpool call centre)- on one of the two occasions the genius in India transferred me to new mortgage applications - thanks for that. The person in new mortgages (Liverpool) then said he would put me straight through to the right person for my question - oops"
Customer_492, Bank account openning ," Basically tried to open a bank account for my sister today and this guy working there comes checking out my passport asking where im from as if that has anything to do with the credit check. Told him im from Greece showed him my sister's passport and her National insurance number that they asked me as a proof of adress. My sister had our previous adress on her NIN letter which makes sense since you get your NIN issued once and not every month. This guy tells us to go to the job center sort out the adress and come back in two weeks time when he would be ready for another appointment and once we tried asking wether the previous adress is a problem he told us im not going to have this conversation again, get out bye. Rudeness at its finest. Went to find one of the customer service women working there in the afternoon and once i start talking to her about it she seemed familiar with the topic as if they had gossiped around it on lunch break and she told me hasnt our employee told you what the problem is? i said yes. And then she said then i see no reason why i should keep talking to you and just left. How do these people even get a job there in the first place. "
Customer_493, Must be lucky?? , I have had only good experiences with BANK_NAME? Their online banking is excellent. 
Customer_494, Wow. ," Opening an account at BANK_NAME is an absolute nightmare. First of all, the branch in Bradford is absolutely swamped with customers and won't take appointments, so it takes forever to even start the process. Then they send you about eight different envelopes and emails, all with different numbers, and it's very unclear what you should use to log onto online banking.I've been trying to set up an account for almost two weeks now, and one would think that a bank would be eager for me to put money into it. If you're coming from overseas, I would recommend checking out some other banks first.Only plus side of my whole experience is that the actual employees I've talked to have been lovely. They have tried to help, it just seems like they're operating within a terrible system. "
Customer_495, Mobile banking app for iPad removed ," BANK_NAME have removed this , and brought out a new one which is similar to the iPhone version, it's supposed to be better but it actually didn't have as many functions. For example I like a ' running balance ' to be shown after each transaction . Being on a budget like most people , this allows you to see 'how you are' on income and expenditure at the same point last month or the month before. The new app for iPad dosnt have this , unlike the previous one, which I was prompted by BANK_NAME into deleting. It's as if they font want you monitor spending efficiently . Be careful before you delete the old version as it seems you can't bring it back "
Customer_496, Madness ," I am trying to close my (old Ing) savings account, purchased by BANK_NAME. I completed the account closure form & sent it to the appropriate department. Today I receive a letter saying you need a copy of my signature & I am to go into a BANK_NAME bank to do this. Just got back, having wasted my time. The list of ID is so prescriptive I cannot provide the identification required. The Ing account was in my maiden name (like many professional women I use my maiden name). My passports are in my married name; I am 69 years old so my driving licence is a pink one and is also in my married name and I have never had a BANK_NAME account. The counter assistant would not accept my birth certificate nor my debit card - as it wasn't BANK_NAME!  Whoever devised this ID list is an idiot, male & I suspect very young!  This is a problem of your making so please let me know how you are going to solve the problem without wasting any more of my time. Of course you insist that the only card  ID I have from BANK_NAME is returned with the closure form. Genius!It gets better! I emailed a complaint to BANK_NAME & got a reply telling me to phone them as they need more information. Of course they have my telephone ID card (which they say should be returned with the account closure form) so I cannot identify myself if I do phone them! I then try to email them, but as soon as I confirm it is concerning an existing complaint I am required to identify myself using the card I had to send to them with the account closure form. They do try to phone me on one occasion but I could not take the call. They asked When I was free to take a call & I responded but I have heard nothing since. What kind of Mickey Mouse organisation is this bank? I can't wait to contact the Ombudsman, although I suspect I shall be in a long queue!! "
Customer_497, Rude and unprofessional. ," The member of staff at BANK_NAME Bishops Stortford branch met me and proceeded to tell me about her itchy tights. When we were seated her tone became confrontational and authoritarian. She barked, what's your overdraft limit'. I said I never need to use it so I couldn't answer the question."" She then told me that as it was my account I should know everything about it and if I couldn't answer the questions she wouldn't be able to help me"". If I hadn't complained I do not think she would have made the extra effort to ask me another more reasonable and answerable question which enabled the verification process to proceed.Having been a BANK_NAME customer for  many years I have been shocked to realise that their standard of customer service has fallen to such a low level. They clearly do not rate customer relations enough to train their staff in how to speak to customers. I will be banking elsewhere in future. """
Customer_498," No common sense,no help. "," I have been trying to clear a Santander credit card  bill from money in my BANK_NAME account for over a month without success.I first tried to do this at a BANK_NAME branch in Bexleyheath which was refurbished to have no cashiers,only machines when it re-opened.Despite several attempts to pay the bill I was constantly told that the payment was over the limit.It was coming from my own account at BANK_NAME from my own money to pay my own bill but it would not let me.As it seems impossible to get cheques from the bank I could not pay with a cheque and bank giro credit either,plus there were no cashiers to give the payment to even if I somehow had an old cheque to use.I had to go to the foreign till(this had a person) and after  many minutes trying to convince them I was not trying to defraud myself they agreed to process the bill.Alas they put in a 4 instead of a 5 as the first number unknown to me and the bill was returned unpaid and even more interest accumulated.Since then I have tried to make the payment by phone a number of times and after going through the long identification process every time am told the system will not allow the payment"".Now it seems these call centres are not  UK based and it proved impossible to explain that I was not trying to defraud myself by paying my own bill with my own money.It was obvious it was me as I answerednumerous questions and was prepared to answer any others they could think of.All they did was to keep me holding on for ages to ask a supervisor only to get the same answer..After being badgered to have on-line or mobile banking which I have refused every time"
Customer_499, I would rather chew a brick then deal with BANK_NAME , I really am surprised how an incompetent company can still function!  They messed up my account three times in a row and placed false information on my credit history.Clearly they don't want any customers! 
Customer_5,Using the app is amazing however......," Using the app is amazing however the automated phone menu/system makes your blood boil.  Tell us the reason you are calling us today   To speak with someone . And thats too much to ask apparently. After 6 hours of trying to get past the automated phone system you then get transferred to India. As lovely as the people are, I simply want to discuss my financial matters with people whereby English is their first language, who understand that the reason Im annoyed is that Ive been speaking with a robot for 8 years prior to them receiving my call. They are absolutely clueless.   Im contemplating suicide however if I manage to get through that Im going to also contemplate leaving BANK_NAME and taking my personal and business accounts elsewhere."
Customer_50,BANK_NAME Mobile Banking no longer works on Samsung/Android,"For a few weeks whenever I logged into the BANK_NAME Mobile Banking App it asked me to upgrade to the latest version. However, this was not possible as a message on the app stated: '! Your device isn't compatible with this version'. I thought this strange as I have a Galaxy 7 Edge and Andriod 7.00, which certainly should not be a problem.  I ignored the message and carried on using the mobile banking app, thinking that whatever the problem was, it would get sorted before too long and in the meantime I'd continue to use the app.  But, then the last time I tried to log in, it would not let me and insisted I had to upgrade to the latest version before it would allow me back in.  I thought this meant they'd now fixed the app, but alas, no.  Several communications later via Facebook and Twitter, the quality of which on some of the replies was abysmal, it is STILL not fixed. All BANK_NAME will say is that they are aware of this 'technical' issue and rest assured they are working to fix it, but they can't give a date when this will be fixed.  Baloney, I believe they are hoping that this problem goes away when next Android updates its operating system, I don't believe they are working on a fix at all and that is why they will not commit to say when the problem will be fixed.  I've decided to open a Monzo account and gradually move all of my business over to it. My son uses Monzo and says it is absolutely fantastic, with real-time updates, etc. They do not and will not have branches, but hey, many of us don't need the bricks and mortar banks any longer anyway."
Customer_500, BANK_NAME business telephone waiting time disgrace. , I am meant to be running a business not sitting waiting for a poorly ruin business to ruin mine.Every time I call business banking I wait 20 minutes plus.Why can't I score zero stars. 
Customer_501, Awful Customer Service , The worst customer service I have encountered in my whole life. I will absolutely be changing banks as soon as I can. So disappointing. 
Customer_502, The worst bank I have encountered even after living in 4 different countries In South East Asia , I have had so many problems with this bank. Spontaneous pin sentry blocking while abroad and unable to unblock it without a new card being sent. Card being sent but no the pin when specifically ask for. Being asked to find a BANK_NAME cash machine abroad otherwise they cannot unblock my pin. Unable to change my bank home address to one abroad without going to the bank. Unable to help me when fraud was on my account because i didn't know one of the three security questions and they didnt have an alternative question.. The suggestion again go to BANK_NAME bank in person. Well they are closing all the banks now and who will pay for the flight and time home when im abroad!!!!!!!! URGGHHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHH!!!!!!! 
Customer_503, Not recomended , They keep refusing my card payment from time to time ok if its at some dodgy merchants buy paypal (I use it regulary for 10years) 
Customer_504, what an absolute shambles , I walked in to make a payment for my elderly neighbour today at the chorlton branch. There was only two cashiers on the desks although the desk had many more spots that could have been used by staff members. The queue of coustomers was nearly out the door. I waited a while whist others were complaining and getting the same answer we are understaffed today. Well I thought why not use the drop off service but ofcorse there was nobody to help me use this service as I've never used it before. I was paying in a fair amount of money so I didn't want to chance it even though a kind member of the public offers to help me. I suggested to your staff maybe they should employ her. I was late for work waiting in a queue I couldn't see moving. This seems to happen every time I go in this branch. Hire more staff because this can't continue. Nobody even apologised. I'm not happy and will be spreading the word about that horrible cold unwelcoming stuffy branch that is chorlton. Maybe I will try again tomorrow when I have an hour to spare. 
Customer_505, Online // Telephone Banking ," Making a bank transfer through BANK_NAME online is almost a miracle.My pinsentry card reader was broken, so I phoned BANK_NAME Customer service on the first of August 2016 I was advised my Pinsentry card reader was ordered for me and I should received it in ten working days, after 15 days as I did not receive it, I phoned them again and no answer was given. After asking for other options to make the bank transfer, I was advised that It could be made on the phone.On the phone, I was asked more than 15 questions, after 50 minutes on the phone (50 euros bill) and answering all of them, I was advised that the bank transfer could not be made, please call again tomorrow"""
Customer_506, Awful customer service ," I have never in my life been treated so badly by customer service assistant. I have been customer of BANK_NAME for over 10 years and their customer service went down hill. All i wanted was to report/cancel my lost card and order a new card to be sent to my address on the record. The customer service assistant was rude, didn't let me talk, was interrupting constantly. I came off the phone shaking and crying. "
Customer_507, No online customer support , I tried to contact support on their website because I was having some issues with one of my credit cards. It took ages to receive a feedback and they asked to call them. I did that and my problem was solved but I would recommend them to improve their online customer support. 
Customer_508, bad bank for customer service ," The branches customer service is the worst in history you can stay on a queue for five hours just to get more cash that you can't get from the machine. The bank is a joke of the century. Staff are very sluggish and careless about customers, they are the whole epitome of frustrated workforce "
Customer_509, I thought my card was blocked! ," After trying to withdraw money from my bank account and it being declined, i was sent a text message asking me to respond with 'Y' if it was me, or 'N' if it wasn't. After replying i was able to withdraw the cash only a minute afterwards! Excellent!   Later on that evening i tried to purchase a years car insurance and my card wasn't being accepted online - i called right away via the App thinking my card had been blocked because of what had happened at lunchtime. I spoke to two amazing people at customer service - a lovely lady, Amy and another man - shame I don't remember his name! They got my card sorted out, put my mind completely at rest and the cherry on the cake was that i was only on the phone for 10 minutes - no hassle, no repeating myself. If only all customer service was as helpful! "
Customer_51,Simply just horrible.They're making you,Simply just horrible.They're making you feel like crap and they can't be bothered to put any effort in helping you. I've been with them for years now but I think it is the time to get my business somewhere else.
Customer_510, Abysmal support & service Start-ups AVOID ," After an excellent account opening and fast turnaround that is where any reasonable service from BANK_NAME business banking stops, we have had so many issues with this bank that to list every one would fill the page,1. Constantly blocking either our card & account when trying to pay our telephony provider (this is a £5 transaction, yet no problem with paying BANK_NAMEcard over £100 a month)2. Allowing cancelled DirectDebits to come out of the account then having the cheek to try and charge us for it.3. The majority of telephone banking staff cannot speak or understand proper english, we have tried three times to have an incorrect payment returned only for the wrong one to be returned leading to more accounting headache for us.The above is a shame because the service from our local branch staff was excellent, but the telephone banking team is abysmal. Now swtiching to another bank as the hassle of sorting this out every week is not worth the free banking period. "
Customer_511, No help with fraud ," I discovered that my card had been used fraudulently to purchase a mountain bike online.  My account was overdrawn as a result.  The attitude of the people at the call centre was appalling - they just spouted gobbledegook from a crib sheet and I might as well have been speaking to a machine. They said I might"" get my money back.  I asked them to contact the bike company to advise them that they should not dispatch the goods but they refused - so I had to. The bike company were very on the ball and had spotted that it was dodgy and did not process the order.  My money is"
Customer_512," Inept, incompetent, discourteous and less than useless "," My first written instruction on my business account was 1/10/2015. Totally ignored. Chased, chased again & again. Still nothing. Spent hours on the phone doing 'international musical chairs' between various call centres. Promised faithfully problems sorted..... to no avail. And so it continues...... all the way to August 2016 for an account switch to another bank and..... they can't even do that ! The reasons ? BANK_NAME hold our business name in 3 separate forms (including the correct one they use for correspondence. The other truncated forms have been created by them and prevent the switch. More complaints, phone calls & letters. Not ONE helpful response that has resolved a SINGLE THING. Draw your own conclusions. It's real and a farce of a bank. "
Customer_513, WORST MORTGAGE PROVIDER EVER ," Absolutely appalling and incompetent level of service.We wanted to port our mortgage across to a new property this year.Firstly, we informed our mortgage advisor of the details of our purchase and of our solicitors details in January of this year, he then promptly passed the details to The Woolwich.Two weeks later, we were informed that our solicitor was not acceptable as they did not appear on The Woolwich approved panel of solicitors, despite this particular solicitor having a current working relationship with The Woolwich, this was confirmed during a phone call to the solicitor.We then faced two weeks of lost time plus the embarrassment of having to explain to our solicitor that we would no longer be pursuing our case with them, fortunately they were very understanding and were also at a loss to understand the actions of The Woolwich.We then found another solicitor, which ultimately would lead to further delays as our original solicitor was dealing with both the sale of our old property and the purchase of our new property.My wife was also asked at this time to provide original copies of her most recent bank statements and wage slips, despite already having provided these.Our youngest daughter was also asked to complete a form a concerning the mortgage conditions as she is over eighteen years of age, despite having signed and returned the same form a few weeks previously.We then waited until the 25th April before we could complete on our new property.Our solicitor wrote to The Woolwich to clarify a couple of points concerning the mortgage conditions and waited four and a half weeks for an answer having written three letters over a period of four weeks.During this period, The Woolwich also received phone calls from us on this matter, only to be met with obscure and meaningless excuses.They also received a number of calls and emails from our mortgage adviser, to no avail.The only response to these requests was to send out a mortgage offer each time instead of answering our solicitor’s query in order to progress.We now have a collection of four identical mortgage offers, the first of which had my wife’s name spelt incorrectly.When the mortgage transferred to our new property, we did not receive a refund of our early repayment charge after the first payment to the new account despite being told that this would be automatically refunded five to ten working days later.Again, this involved many phone calls from both us and our mortgage adviser, with no results.They even asked us for the account number relating to the refund when they had these details in front of them!! We eventually received the refund over a month later.I cannot believe the amateurish and incompetent excuses we were given when trying to communicate problems to them.Both my wife and I ended up on anti depressants due to the stress created, I am still considering taking legal action against them and have The Woolwich named on my medical records as a direct cause of stress.My wife and I have vowed to never involve ourselves with The Woolwich again, when our five year fixed period expires on our mortgage, we will be looking for a more competent mortgage provider.

Customer_514, customer services , somewhere in India - they just don't understand..... 
Customer_515, Newport Pagnell branch , Very good customer service.  Helped me set up an account quickly and listened to my needs. 
Customer_516, Very bad Customer Services Walsall branch , BANK_NAME Walsall are very bad treat you like dirt un help full lost my money or they stole it. there counter staff are very rude the women and the branch manager is even worse its our money not your she said excuse me it is my hard earned money i want it back thieves 
Customer_517, BANK_NAME business account is a joke ," If you want to run a business don't have a business account with BANK_NAME. As soon as you buy something from overseas they will block your debit card. They won't tell you it's blocked until you buy something and get declined. You then have to jump through more hoops than a acrobat only for them to tell you that you have to go into branch with 2 forms of ID. What they don't tell you is that one of those HAS to be a passport. I don't have a passport so it took me kicking off in branch to get them to accept my driving licence to shut me up in front of other customers. Then despite me paying monthly for the privilege to hold this account the fraud team tell me that they are doing ME a favour accepting a government produced piece of ID!! WOW!! Don't think a complaint will get anywhere either, I'm still awaiting for a reply from over 2 months ago. They credited my account with £10 to try and shut me up!I've had my debit card blocked every time I make an overseas business purchases. Despite reassurances I never receive a call or email. It's impossible to run a business with BANK_NAME unless you only do business within the UK. "
Customer_518, The people on the phone tell lies! The Live Chat take forever! , The people at BANK_NAME are rude the staff are rude to me when I went to branch so I told them that I want an appointment they said we have 1 appointment available in 2 months! I said f*** that to them walked straight out and walked in to Halifax next door and they said they could see me straight away! I had a Current Account with them within 5 mins of walking out of BANK_NAME and they were really nice!!! Don't go to BANK_NAME switch to Halifax best Customer Services on phone and live chat!! Well done Halifax Accrington 11-00-08 Definantly recommend Halifax Bank 
Customer_519," Staff were incredibly rude, unhelpful and wouldn't even give me an appointent to discuss applying for a mortgage "," I have been with this bank since I opened an account at 16, I have been reliable and never asked anything of the bank other than to keep my money safe. I have just bought my first house no thanks to BANK_NAME. I was rejected from my first choice of mortgage and the member of staff dealing with my application advised me to go to my own bank, BANK_NAME, as I'd probably get a mortgage with them a lot easier since I've been with them for so long. However, BANK_NAME refused to even offer me an appointment and straight out told me the following word by word; You're wasting your time. If one bank rejects you the rest of them will"". This treatment was appalling"
Customer_52,Not too bad,"  I've been with BANK_NAME for many years and never had a problem until recently.. this was sorted, eventually. Good app, easy to use services, not great customer service - they could do with more training but that's the same for all call centres I guess, it's the luck of the draw on who you get put through to."
Customer_520, Card Blocked while in Italy ," I do not often have to complain about BANK_NAME's service as it is usually very good but I am afraid once again they have left me totally in the lurch.I should say first of all that my account is several thousand pounds in credit.A few weeks ago I was sent a new BANK_NAME Card. This was a bit of a surprise as my current one does not expire until Feb 2019 but I thought it might be quite useful having two.As I was just about to set off for a trip around Europe, I thought no more about it and it seemed wisest to leave the other one safely at home.In the last day or so, I found I was unable to use my card. It was unclear whether this was to do with the Banking System in Italy, which is where I am now or whether my card had been blocked for some reason. I had not received any emailed or texted notifications so phoned in to check.It seems that:-1) Yes, the card has now been stopped2) The person answering my call was unable to do anything about it.3) I will have either to ask a relative to post my new card to me, or somehow manage on the generosity of others until I return to the UK.4) That basically I am left on holiday without funds.I think this is very bad indeed.It seems BANK_NAME think it perfectly ok to cancel a card being used in Italy only two days ago, without making any attempt to query me or warn me and are now unwilling to temporarily unblock it.I must ask the questions:If my card was potentially compromised, why was it ok to leave it working for 4 weeks?Since it was being used during that period in Portugal, France and Italy why was I sent no further warnings that this was likely to happen?Why is there apparently no emergency procedure to look after my needs in the short term? "
Customer_521, fantastic experience which meant a lot! ," After using a cash point to draw out over £100, the cash point froze, then after 5 mins returned my card, no cash.  After checking online, the money had ben removed from my account...grrr!  I couldn't think of anything worse than trying to contact BANK_NAME thinking of the endless menus to get in touch.However, through online banking located a button to just press 'call' and straight through to an actual human!  Sorted in under 2 mins.Like banking should be!! Well done BANK_NAME - the little things really count! "
Customer_522, Walthamstow High street branch - unheard of arrogance ," They booked appointment for me at a different branch without telling me, thus wasting my time. When I have asked about this this they were non-apologetic, arrogant and did not even try to help. Incompetent, arrogant staff, especially the Manager on duty on 20/07/2016. I am disgusted with how I was treated by the arrogant manager. He dared to raise his voice with me. Avoid!!! "
Customer_523, Applying for a Student Overdraft - a 2 hour+ wait in branch and nothing solved ," Anyone applying for a Student Overdraft with your Student Additions account? I hope you have a better experience than this:Currently a PhD student, my account with BANK_NAME dates back to my undergraduate studies. I only recently discovered that I can actually have an overdraft - £2,000, not my £10 overdraft I had during my undergraduate studies. (As a non-British student some other banks refused me when I wanted to open an account in 2012, and I eventually did it with BANK_NAME as it had the easiest procedures for someone in my situation - for that, the review won't be 1*).But fast forward to today, 19 July 2016. On my online banking, it is written clearly that I have to go IN BRANCH to apply for my overdraft. 1.20 pm. I show up in one of the Cambridge branches. A young lady asks me how can she help. Everything good so far. I say it's about the student overdraft, and she tells me this is done by video banking nowadays. She adds,  please take a seat and wait"" (there was only 1 video banking machine and was busy at that moment). I wait"
Customer_524, BANK_NAME.net a huge step backwards ," Having used BANK_NAME internet banking (BIB) for several years for business banking we are now being compelled to use their new system BANK_NAME.net"" and access to the BIB system is being withdrawn in a few days whether we like it or not. BANK_NAME.net is seriously deficient in facilities for business users and having spent many hours on the phone to their support desk it is clear that their staff are equally unable to explain how to perform some of the simplest but business critical daily functions.Like some of the other contributors to this review we are also now looking for a new bank. """
Customer_525, Terrible costumer service , Bank as back is OK. People at my branch are quite helpful too but.....online or phone costumer service is....lack of words - is that bad!!!!Example. I used BANK_NAME online live chat the other day - asked if I can have another credit card with them (explained everything in detail) and....person on other end kept me waiting (saying he's looking for an answer) and then.....he said I can and....guess what?! I can NOT. I've applaied for one and they turned me away straight away. Very poor experience especially when everything is going online now and there is such a competition out there too....If I could I would NOT give even one star!!!! And I'm considering moving my accounts somewhere else because there is that much you can take 
Customer_526," Sometimes OK, sometimes terrible "," BANK_NAME can be an OK bank, providing normal services in a normal way.  However, I am a premier client with them, and I just spent *35 minutes* o the phone with them, just trying to change a simple direct debit.  They said they were waiting for confirmation from their Fraud Department, and that they could not ring me back or allow me to ring them back to finish the transaction.  Really terrible service today! "
Customer_527, Fraud protection / Customer care terrible ," Been a BANK_NAME customer for 20 years. Today, I applied to Santander. The reason? We cannot spend our own money due to fraud protection. I'm on hold now, greater than 10 mins wait just to access my own money. 2 months ago I did actually discover fraud on my business account. Someone had been ordering paintings and clothes on my business account. Guess what? BANK_NAME didn't even pick it up. Useless bank. Useless customer care. "
Customer_528, Complaints Handling ," Made a complaint about bank charges on my basic current account for the period of 2010-2014 when I was in severe financial hardship where the charges simply compounded the situation.Within 25 minutes i received a call from a lady (didnt give her name) stating that I would not be due any redress due to the high court ruling of 2009 and that charges were fair and I could call their financial assistance helpline and go to the financial ombudsman if I so wished as this was their final response. I tried to advise her that what she is saying has nothing to do with my complaint, I had complained about financial hardship not fairness. I didnt need the financial helpline now as it was a period for 2 years ago. I asked if she would reassess my complaint as i do not think it was addressed correctly to which she said no. I was frustrated and asked if she could advise what investigations took place since how could a final response be reached within 25 minutes of my complaint being raised when you are looking at 48 months of account but she would not tell me. I asked again if she would reassess my complaint, she said no, that i could go to the ombudsman and that she was going to end the call- total call time less than 6 minutes. I raised a further complaint about how this was handled and my treatment- She would not listen, was abrupt, had not investigated my complaint properly or answer my questions. To this, I had a call back from BANK_NAME from a different gentleman. He was pleasant enough to deal with but was basically defending her actions. He still could not grasp that what she had advised me had nothing to do with the premise of my complaint. Really let down that I made two complaints and neither were investigated properly nor my questions given any consideration. First staff member was pious and abrupt. I would not mind the outcome of any complaint as long as I feel it was dealt with fairly and given due consideration. This was merely cleared as quickly as possible. Not a happy bunny, will be going to the ombudsman (which will cost them more than my entire claim) and closing my account. "
Customer_529, So many anti-fraud measures you can barley access your own money ," I recently moved to the UK and had the misfortune of opening a BANK_NAME Account.After receiving my first months wages from work I needed to pay rent.What a circus ...Log onto the online bankingcan't add a new payee ... need to get the app on my phone (apparently this helps prevent fraud)download the app to my phone,register it to me email, (apparently this helps prevent fraud)put an sms code in to prove I have a phone (not necessarily the same phone but apparently this helps prevent fraud)App still doesn't work!Now i have to visit a cash machine, put my card in, put a code from the app into the cash machine, now the cash machine gives me a different code I have to put back into the appNow the app finally works. Hooray!!!I log back onto the online banking, go to add the new payee... you can't add a new payee because that feature is locked out for the first 10 days ... (apparently this helps prevent fraud)So I call the phone banking ... another pin code to log inI get connected to a call centre somewhere in Asia (I feel so secure about my money right now) then Old Mate on the other end of the phone miss-spells the name of the Payee, so the transfer bounces anyway.F#### you very much BANK_NAME!The next time I visit will be to close my account. "
Customer_530, Must have all gone to Europe!!!!! , Held on phone for over 40 minutes and still not answered1. Rubbish Company deserve - minus 100*  Scandalous! In fact they deserve to not be in business.  Just trying to report a fraud. 
Customer_531," BANK_NAME Bank, We dont mind because you don't matter "," I have a business & personal account with BANK_NAME and use internet banking 99% of the time.Recently used the business call centre to enquire about an overdraft, OH MY GOD!!!!!!!.It took 35 minutes on hold before I finally spoke to someone. I went through a 40 minute questionnaire about my business etc. All looked good until they did a credit search and said I was bankrupt. In reality I have a perfect credit rating, have various other finance agreements  but they just cut me short and said I would be sent a decline letter.Concerned I phoned the 3 main UK credit agencies and was told that there is no bankruptcy showing on my reports and more interestingly BANK_NAME had not even carried out a soft credit search on me or my company.I called BANK_NAME the next day to explain, and had what I can only describe as the most frustrating phone call I have ever had in my entire life.In the end they told me I was a bankrupt and there was nothing they could do about it. Totally dissatisfied with this answer I made an appointment with the Chelmsford branch via another call centre.1 Hour before the meeting, having taken the morning off work, I was called by the branch and told by a chap that he had me booked in his diary but couldn't see me as he was not a business manager and he was double booked anyway.Anyway,I made good use of my morning off to go into another bank and cannot wait to get away from this bunch of unhelpful, unprofessional pathetic excuse of a Bank. "
Customer_532, St Albans BANK_NAME- Rubbish Service. Change your bank ," Tried to change my business bank account statement correspondence address twice as I forgot my PIN no. Went to the branch at St Albans- twice. The 1st time at the bank, a few months ago- I am told to guess and punch PIN no three times. Then told me it's locked out. I am to go home and online and get it unlock. Wham bam thank you mam. All my fault. That's it.. Who cares?  !!   2nd time- yesterday. Older staff was polite and tried to help. Told me that the business staff can help to change my address on their computer. I had my debit card and bank statements etc. I went upstairs as advised and a 'large' staff said (abruptly) it cannot be done. I am to go home and online to sort it out myself.Then the younger cashier told me to go back upstairs. The younger staff I met were quite blase and sounded abrupt (from the front door to the counter staff). Where do they get their staff from? Where is the customer service training? If I was sick and they are the only medics available, I wouldn't see them.. Can they or can't they help? Will they? Certainly not !!! Wasted my time and journey as usual. I rang BANK_NAME Online helpline and I was passed around a few people. Security checked at least 4 or 5 times by repeating myself Finally after about an hour :(( , I managed to change my address... That was the last straw. I have made appointment to move my account to another bank within the next week. Surely any bank is better than BANK_NAME?I have closed my account at BANK_NAME and moved my account now!!I have moved my business account to HSBC. Go there, go anywhere instead.. I was treated with more courtesy and staff was very helpful. So was the telephone helpline. I am happy bunny now "
Customer_533, Lol Nothing to say ," I opened a new account with BANK_NAME Online......Received my debit card, letters etc and just 3 days later got a text message, DEBIT CARD is deactivated due to fraudulent .......... call o8oo.So I did listened to the rubbish she came out with and then explained only had the account for 3 days so no money in or out??????What fraud have I committed, No apology and no reply.....I am glad It happened before I actually transferred anything to this bank. Not to be trusted.... I checked my credit file there was no issue??? BANK_NAME AT LEAST TELL THE TRUTH.. "
Customer_534, Under Staffed and silly waiting times. , BANK_NAME are now expecting everyone to do their own banking at branch using the machines.I pay bank charges and as a business customer paying in cash and cheques this is totally unacceptable.....will be changing banks. 
Customer_535, Awful ," We have been with BANK_NAME 9 years, in that time we have had one mess after another.  Firstly they refused to change my name on the account after my deed poll.  Stating that the deed poll was not official, despite the same one being ised to change both my passport and driving license.  Then they changed it after a 16 week wait to see our business manager, then two days later it reverted back.  We have had unathorised transactions that no one could explain, and now they have suddenly changed the automatic"" decsion on our our account wothout telling us.  The call centre use to be great"
Customer_536," awful rude staff, 50 minute wait thorpe bay BANK_NAME "," thorpe bay BANK_NAME is the most poorly managed, awful bank ive ever been to. you often have to wait 50 minutes or more to get served by the only cashier open. the self serve machines do not replace cashier services will the banks ever learn that its not about saving themselves money by putting in these awful machines, the customers dont want them, they are not quicker, keep the cashiers open and reduce the queuing times. awful, awful thorpe bay BANK_NAME "
Customer_537," Shocking bank, very rude staff "," Been with BANK_NAME eleven years and customer service gets worse steadily by the year. I will be opening a new account with another bank tomorrow as I've had enough now! Most recently, I wasted 45mins on the phone talking to a very incompetent, rude customer service agent who kept me on hold twice and eventually declared her computer is not working and I should call back. No apology, nothing. Just said you have to call back"
Customer_538, Poor service - one of the worst banks for customer service , Went into Swindon regent street branch to open an account for my son today - greeter was hopeless - never asked if I was a premier customer and wasted my time - offered me an appointment to set up an account in 18 days time - what a joke . Looks like customer service is not important - one of the worst banking experiences ever  - offered a times lot that was during the middle of the day on a week day as they don't set up new accounts on weekends !!!!!!! So went to Halifax bank - who set up a new account in 10 mins with no appointment - much better customer service and a pleasure to deal with. BANK_NAME need to improve their customer service massively 
Customer_539," Uncaring, unreasonable and rude "," Like many on here being kept on hold for hours then cut off with no explanation. Customer service representatives who have no idea what they are doing so always asking someone else for help. Had a credit card for £1000 on my business account which was overpaid regularly before the due date. After paying £500 off the £900 balance one month it was reduced straight after payment with no warning. When asked why it seems I did not meet their financial criteria at that time. I am of the same opinion as many others who consider  BANK_NAME devious, untrustworthy and totally unprofessional. I am due to finish a degree so BANK_NAME will not be benefiting  from my new income levels. Trust works both ways. "
Customer_54,When I call BANK_NAME I refuse to speak,"When I call BANK_NAME I refuse to speak to any of the advisors in India for various reasons, so I always request to speak to a English call centre which they don't mind putting me through.   However today I find out the UK call centres close between 9pm-10.30pm, I find this very strange, why do they close the UK call centres for 90 minutes at those times? Apparently it's due to a staff changeover, I've never ever heard this before."
Customer_540, Unathotised transactions , I would stay well clear of BANK_NAME as today I has a payment come out of my account that I didn't authorise to come out I then contacted the bank who were very unhelpful in dealing with this and I was told there was nothing they was going to do about this and they put the phone down on me... I then rang them back to talk to a manager who told me the exact same that they wasn't going to do anything about this and if I wanted something doing about it I had to take the matter to court since then I have been on the phone to my bank most of today to try and get this matter resolved after talking to a deferent person every time I was told different information everyone I called and when I told them I will be leaving them and going to a different bank all they said was ok that's fine they are nothing but a waste of space!!!! 
Customer_541, Zero customer service ," Definitively BANK_NAME is a very tiresome bank. They decided, on their own, to convert my Current Account Plus into a BANK_NAME Bank Account without asking me. They added since this past 13th May some services I am not interested at all but of course I will have to pay for them!!You want to claim and you have to log in, to confirm your passcode, your ID, and many other steps and when you try to chat none is in the other side.They are closing many branches in the High Streets because they want to bring better customer service!!??. Of course, now you have an online  24/7 service for you to talk to them. Who is thinking of calling a bank on Sunday at 3am or on Wednesday at 10pm or on Thursday at 12am ... It is ridiculous. And also, which kind of banking expertise are able to provide via those services, by phone or chat?. Accenture some months ago posted a report about how much customers miss human interactions and expertise and this bank is removing it at the time than increasing fees with the excuse they want to provide better services. More banks are suffering now from their own blindness, they are unable to move on appropriately in the market. If you want to be online 100% be cheaper.I am exhausted already of trying to find them on the phone, chat or sending an email. I will cancel my personal and business account very soon. They are terrible. "
Customer_542, Worst Bank I've ever been with ," Been in UK for a year now. Delayed payments, Non-accurate transaction history, constantly down services. Worst bank I've ever been with. Do yourself a favour & stay away from BANK_NAME. "
Customer_543, BANK_NAME have been very good. ," To be honest, we opened a buisness account in worksop, and they have been brilliant. Our buisness manager michelle has been great, always there to help.  We do most of our banking in Retford,  Where we need £10,000 out at times,  they have never let us down. Excellent service, would recomend.....  THE RETFORD CAR COMPANY. "
Customer_544, BANK_NAME' non communication ," I am trying to cash in a bond.  BANK_NAME keep saying I have not filled in the form.  I have-twice, and posted it twice.   Once it might go missing, but two times - I doubt it.  I've tried phoning - phone goes dead.  I've tried emailing - no answer.  The bank will not tell me what is going on or give me my money.  My cash isn't banked at BANK_NAME, it's serving life imprisonment. "
Customer_545, Beyond Abysmal ," BANK_NAME are the worst organisation I have ever encountered. After TEN YEARS they STILL send statements to the wrong address, even though every time I ring them I change the addess and someone assures me it’s been updated. They block my card and suspend my account constantly, in the name of fraud protection. It gets to the point that even buying groceries in the supermarket causes them to block my card. Their customer service is deplorable beyond words. My worst experience was when I lost my card while in South America. When I rang them they made me go through byzantine security checks and then told me they couldn’t block my account (for the first time ever...) because I had failed the security check. The man on the phone would not give any more details. When I asked them to send me a new card, he refused. So did his supervisor. When I asked how the hell I was supposed to get home with no money, he told me to “pop into my local branch”. I explained that my nearest branch was 5,000 miles away. He said he could not offer further assistance and hung up. When I finally got home (thanks to a friend and Western Union) I went straight into BANK_NAME to find out what was going on. The “Customer Care” rep was extremely reluctant to let me see my own account on screen, and when I was eventually allowed to look at my own information i was told that the phone moron doing the security checks had been reading the wrong information. The only reason I didn’t close the account was the sheer hassle, but as I have just this minute had my card suspended for trying to buy groceries in the same supermarket I use my card in every week, I am closing my account. BANK_NAME behind-the-scenes personnel are the rudest, most breathtakingly incompetent people I have met, and the organisation as a whole is a total shambles. "
Customer_546, Idiot Sean foster , This manager supposedly says other than the CEO he's the next guvnor!!!the bluudy cheek!!!Have a financial ombudsman complaint multiple ones including fraud that they never addressed...beware 
Customer_547, Terrible Phone Customer Service ," Unacceptable behaviour. We went into a branch to sort out some stuff with my fathers account as his English is not excellent so it was a more convenient option. To our disappointment it didn't live to our expectations, even though the people in Bromley branch serving as were nice, Shahinul and Tanya, and tried their best to accommodate our needs, one of our problems had to be sorted over the phone and customer service representative was extremely rude, Mr Kalpam Pachauri, he had screamed at my farther for wasting his time and instead of dealing with the issue we had kept on complaining to us that we didn't understand what he wanted telling us he didn't have time for this. How can someone not have time to do his own job? My poor farther experienced such a shock from this service that his blood pressure increased by far. Further to this we were offered further reviews on our account but the person dealing with us ran out of time and told us he wont be able to accommodate. Even though Shahinul Ali was a very nice man I don't think it was very professional to offer us a service that the bank personnel wasn't able to accommodate. Knowing we have experienced such a horrible service prior to this, it didn't help our overall experience.  A very disappointed customer, and certainly wont be recommending BANK_NAME bank. "
Customer_548," Expensive and terrible, avoid at all costs ", Worst customer service that exists in any industry.For 3 years I have suffered error after error by BANK_NAME's.They are incompetent beyond words. I am now going to close all accounts even though its a pain.They are expensive and have the worst processes I have ever experienced.How they have any customers is a mystery in line with the Pyramids and Quantum Physics. 
Customer_549, Terrible , Terrible service from branch to branch-- not being able to open a credit card in branch nor make an appointment to do so. 
Customer_55,Using the app is amazing however......,"Using the app is amazing however the automated phone menu/system makes your blood boil.  Tell us the reason you are calling us today   To speak with someone . And thats too much to ask apparently. After 6 hours of trying to get past the automated phone system you then get transferred to India. As lovely as the people are, I simply want to discuss my financial matters with people whereby English is their first language, who understand that the reason I'm annoyed is that Ive been speaking with a robot for 8 years prior to them receiving my call. They are absolutely clueless.   Im contemplating suicide however if I manage to get through that I'm going to also contemplate leaving BANK_NAME and taking my personal and business accounts elsewhere."
Customer_550, WARNING - Do NOT bank with BANK_NAME!!! ," After 3 years, BANK_NAME closed both my business and personal accounts without a valid explanation. I called to find out if it was a mistake and they said that I no longer met their financial criteria. I asked what criteria I failed on? He said he could not give any more details. I logged a complaint and got a called from  an unknown number.I asked how my credit/fraud ratings would be affected.He said as it is a two month notice there was no effect on either my credit nor fraud rating and it was no different from me closing my account myself!So the only take I had on this was that I was not a profitable BANK_NAME customer! That I can somehow understand.To my utter dismay however, I tried to move funds from my accounts online to my other bank to prepare with the closing down of my account - only to find that it had been blocked - no warning. I called them back and they confirmed it. In fact ALL facilities - debit card, online banking, etc had been withdrawn!I had spoken to two different people on the same day and they never mentioned this. I expected to have at least a month of the two months to sort things out.As a result of this fiasco, I have had to cancel my business travel plans in order to sort this out.The whole thing just does not make moral sense and something really should be done about it.So my advise to any one is to avoid BANK_NAME. "
Customer_551, Transaction updates slow and non existent. ," Slow, pathetic customer service who are constantly having technical difficulties. transaction updates are useless, payment come out/show up DAYS later than what they should have, one came out a month late and they blamed the company that took the money out.Catching me off guard a number of times.Good-bye BANK_NAME. "
Customer_552," Careless rules, procedures but more importantly staff "," My account had been suspended, for some reason the company wouldn't even explain to me. After days of calling up and getting no where, i finally found out it was due to someone i didn't even know putting money in to my account and trying to take it out. And from this i was to suffer, and have no access to my money to pay for food, fuel to get to work. BANK_NAME said my account wont be active for at least another week, so im left with nothing and there is nothing they can do. DONT GO WITH BANK_NAME! "
Customer_553, Transaction update frequency ," Online banking: transactions are updated with horrible 2-3 days delay. Over the weekend they don't update a single transaction and the account balance is horribly inadequate.  After checking her account balance yesterday night, my wife went shopping today afternoon. But guess what? She ended up with refused payment as none of her card weekend transactions were included in her account balance.This is just embarrassing. Just waiting for my paycheck this month and switching to BANK_NAME or BANK_NAME - the further from BANK_NAME, the better. "
Customer_554, Blue BANK_NAME Rewards Useless ," Hi all, I have been a BANK_NAME customer for 4-5 years now. I heard of Blue Rewards at the begining of 2016 and decided to apply for it from February onwards since I was perfectly eligible:1 - I get paid every month above the requirement of 800 pounds2 - I make at least two debit card transactions every month3 - As part of the Blue rewards I paid 3 pounds out of my account every month.I have been paying this amount since February every on the on the 2nd and was meant to receive 7 pounds every month on the 12th but have not received anything. Since February I have called them 4-5 times and all they tell me is that its a maintenance problem. They sent me to a branch and they also put me on the phone there. Going to the branch was a total waste of time because they still were not able to help me. Its been almost three months now and they haven't resolved the issue yet. I am considering changing banks now because I lost my trust in BANK_NAME. "
Customer_555, Utterly awful from start to end ," An absolute ballache, for unaccounted for missing money and not being able to track where it had gone whilst I was travelling, to cancelling my card and ordering a new one to my old address without telling me, PRETENDING to order me a new card so I'm without a card or source of payment for direct direct debits and simple money transfers for over a week. Absolute joke, just took myself to BANK_NAME so I can close this account after my next paycheque. "
Customer_556, Another rubbish company , Be very careful if shopping online and you wanna open dispute the corruption system won't help you 
Customer_557, UNABLE TO GET THROUGH BY PHONE TO REPORT LOST CARD ," BANK_NAME have an appalling attitude when it come to the safety of your card or the service experience of their customers.After waiting 30 minutes on hold to report my 94yo mother-in-law's lost bank card I hung up and tried again but the same thing.  So I called as if to pay the balance on my card and got through immediately!  Indian call centre of course.  I explained that I actually needed to report a lost card and they transferred my call.  After another 30 minutes I hung up, called as if to pay a bill and insisted to speak to a manager.  He stated he could not help but promised to put my call through and would monitor my call to ensure it got through.  It didn't and after 20 minutes he gave up and just left me to it.  After another 20 minutes I hung up again.This was late at night and my mother in law who had tried to answer questions asked by the to verify her ID was getting exhausted so I hung up and promised my mother in law we would go to a branch the following morning.  She spent all night worrying about her card and it made her quite ill.I find it appalling that BANK_NAME make it impossible to report a lost card over the phone and their call centre staff are next to useless.Just wish I could award 0 stars.  BANK_NAME, you have lost two long standing customers. "
Customer_558, BANK_NAME in Camberley ," have decided in their wisdom, to replace all but one cashier with computers, which means when you have to do a transaction where you cant use a machine you can wait for ages. I have waited for 35 minutes, with two people in front of me and 45 minutes with four people in front of me, who has the time for this. Perhaps if they put more cashiers and better service in the branches they wouldn't have to spend so much money on TV advertising. I have closed my account in favour of a bank that provides a decent service. "
Customer_559, If you think you get a bad deal from BANK_NAME.... , ...I business bank with BANK_NAME (Over £1million a year) + they earn good money out of us but do we get a good service? No chance they could not care less. They treat their business customers just as badly as they treat someone with a small current account balance.You can thank our politicians and the ombudsman for letting the big banks walk all over their customers. 
Customer_560, They don' listen ," Away from home at the moment and lost my handbag with my purse, bank cards and bus/train passes in. Went into a BANK_NAME branch to cancel cards and see if I could get any money as I had no means of getting to where I was staying. Expected to be asked lots of questions but guy kept saying have you got your passport. How many people carry their passport whilst travelling in this country? Eventually he agreed to give me £20 so that I could get a bus to where I was staying. He told me he had cancelled my cards. I told him I had two and he said it would do both of them. Went into another branch today to see if There was any way I could get some cash only to be told one of the cards was still active. Brilliant so much for being a premier customer. "
Customer_561, Customer service is non existent ," Recently had the pleasure of porting an existing mortgage, the whole process from start to finish was a disgrace. From the branch to the contact centre. Different information from anyone I spoke to. They sent my loan papers to the wrong solicitor which is obviously holding things up. When my fixed rate is up i'm off.  I can't believe how bad the service is from a company this size. "
Customer_562, Beware the mis-sold SmartSpend SCAM ," I recently made two purchases on the BANK_NAME SmartSpend (smart?) scheme. This scheme purports to pay a set percentage of the transaction back to the customer. A further 1% is supposedly added later if you are a Rewards customer (unlikey). However on checking my purchase records 3% of £499 spend states a £12.47 cashback and the second transaction of 2% of £79 states £0.98 cashback. Small short change but multiply that by a few thousand transactions a month and it's quite a significant amount isn't it? Attempting to speak to their ridiculous call centre was over three hours of nonsense. Nobody there understood the SmartSpend concept at all and did all they could to stop a formal complaint being registered. This is a shame because the staff at my local branch would easily have sailed through a 5-star rating. Having a call centre staffed by people who cannot understand the banks own schemes, or English if you try to explain the scheme, is ridiculous. To refuse to lodge a customers complaint is shameful and clearly common practice as three staff refuged to log the complaint.February 2017 - and STILL the same useless service from BANK_NAME. Call centres that no almost zero English and have no idea of the Smartpend scheme at all. "
Customer_563, Obviously not interested in new customers! ," I rang the main BANK_NAME call centre due to not being able to complete an application online for a financial product. I arranged an appointment for two weeks' time at my local branch to finish the application. Was told I would receive a text to confirm and that the personal banker would also call me the day before the appointment. Received neither of these so the afternoon prior, I called again and as the appointment was for the following day they sent a priority e-mail to the named staff member I was due to be seeing asking to call me first thing (on the appointment day). No call received. This tells me all I need to know about the company and will go elsewhere for my finance needs, to a company that actually does what they say they will. The fact that they never respond to criticism on this site speaks volumes. "
Customer_564, Debit Card Replacement ," Please leave while you can. BANK_NAME can actually ruin your life. So I am currently away from the UK and my debit card expired. Due to currency fluctuations in the country I am in presently, I decide why don't I just call BANK_NAME customer care change my address to an international one and get my new debit card sent to me so I pay for visa application and my flight. Apparently BANK_NAME changed my address, and then flags my order as a fraud. International calls cost an arm and a leg here lost all my limbs calling BANK_NAME customer care and Fraud. All I am told now is to visit my nearest branch with and ID which I have already presented to open the account. So now I can't apply for a visa and can't pay my flight ticket. In conclusion, BANK_NAME will ruin your life. Close your account if you can, a dog provides better banking services. "
Customer_565, Ridiculous Customer Service ," Normally I am not one to write reviews, however the time I have wasted by simply trying to open a student account is absolutely ridiculous. The first time I went to validate documents I got sent away because the letter from the university did not include Manchester"" after the postcode"
Customer_566, BANK_NAME taking many old transactions out on the same day , As you may know this weekend was the Easter Bank Holiday. Before the bank holiday started i had £439 left in my account. I checked my account this morning and i realized that BANK_NAME had made sure that 18 transactions came out of my account earlier today despite most of them being made two days before the 29th March. One of them was payment of £180 from a Private Medical Firm that I paid on Thursday 24th March.I'm seriously thinking of leaving BANK_NAME as you just can't trust what's happening with your money.At least I have a back up option as i also have a Nationwide Account. I trust Nationwide a lot more with my money. 
Customer_567, Advised the BANK_NAME bank system doesnt take bank holidays into account!!! ," I put a cheque in with BANK_NAME and as it was before a bank holiday I called to check when the funds would be available to which I was advised it would be cleared in my account for use the following Tuesday after the bank holiday. Given the info I used the funds in my account, only to find on the Tuesday that none of my payment (mortgage etc) had been paid and no sign of the cheque. After speaking with them I was advised by three people, One stated Tuesday another Wednesday and the third Thursday but nothing could be done to help given the miss-advised. The excuse given was that the system hadn't taken into account the BANK holidays which in itself is amazing and their people clearly don't have this info to advise customer correctly. No only have none of my bills been paid I've also wasted a day sorting this mess out. Thanks BANK_NAME, the one time I have to talk to you and that what I got. "
Customer_568, Dreadful , This is just not what I pay my money for. £10 per month to experience poor service over 4 calls with someone that cannot understand me and is condescending.

When I asked for an explanation pointing out if I withdrew sterling from a sterling account there'd be no charge there was no answer. I intend to report this to the ombudsman. This is simply fraud 
Customer_576, awful awful awful ," We had our mortgage transfered to BANK_NAME from woolwich. We are currently overseas and need access to our mortgage online. They sent us the details to do this including access codes and account numbers... we logged in once and have since had our account access suspended. Not one single person can tell us why. They pass the buck, leave us on hold and make up reasons as to why it may be. The latest reason being we don't have a BANK_NAME current account. We have never wanted one, and cannot open one as we are not in  the country. To add insult to injury they gave us an 0800 number to ring for phone banking which doesnt work from overseas. We have spent hours on hold (to be cut off) and their staff have been nothing but incompetent, unhelpful and seemingly untrained. They know nothing of their own policies or procedures and responses vary from day to day. Avoid them like the plague... "
Customer_577, Terrible - and I'm a potential customer - I'll find another bank ," I wanted to get some information about opening an account with BANK_NAME, to deposit my monthly salary into - and the customer service on the phone was absolutely appalling. I then tried the Online Chat facility on the website, to try to ask some questions, and it was even more appalling than the Call Centre. Thanks BANK_NAME for making it very clear to a potential customer how bad the service is...I will be opening my bank account with another company, and avoiding BANK_NAME for life. Uninformed staff who don't even understand simple questions in plain English - like how long does it take to open an account?"". """

"
Customer_579, Very poor in branch service ," Not sure what is actually happening in regards to customer service in this country? (it seems to be non existent)Nowhere is this more obvious than BANK_NAME's bank in southwick (near Brighton Sussex) you are treated as if you do not exist, 30 - 40 minute wait is the norm , This morning  5 or more staff mooching about with only one cashier open ?, 10 maybe 15 customers waiting, and no one says anything ? Except  me Again!The blinds are pulled down on the other cashiers and BANK_NAME's staff try there best to pretend and ultimately ignore the fact there is a stream of customers waiting !!As i say you are treated as if you do not exist ,  When i spoke up and basically questioned why there was not another cashier open? one was then opened . Then apparently from nowhere comes a member of BANK_NAME's staff who then persisted on questioning the customers as to why they were in the bank? and could there have not been another way to deal with there banking today ?With the exception of one woman behind myself NO-ONE SPOKE UP ?they just stood in the queue like sheep and continued to be treated as if they do not exist ! I was then told the wait was down to a set of exceptional circumstances ? However as i have previously stated its the norm in this bank to wait 30 mins plusSo with regards to customer service in branch banking at BANK_NAME's or any other bank , it remains poor because we allow it!! If customers do not make it aware they are unhappy about the customer service they receive it will REMAIN poor.Personally i think the company's in question should be invoiced for the your time, yep that`s right Charge them .For sure you put a foot out of line, and BANK_NAME`s will charge you! and if there is one thing that will grab their attention its MONEY !!!! "
Customer_58,BANK_NAME - customers as money cows," i have had many interactions with BANK_NAME over the past 40 years both as a customer and a shareholder and have never had anything but terrible customer service - they persuaded me to stay with them when they acquired the Charles Schwab stockbroking business and for 2 years it was not bad. From 2007 it went downhill and has recently hit rock bottom, Even as a shareholder their actions cost me money. It has over the decades become apparent that here is a company run for the benefit of the directors, with little ethical direction. When I started University in the 1970 BANK_NAME was portrayed as a support of apartheid, and now with having been fined, and with legal cases against them  in the pipeline the quest for making money regardless of the cost is only too apparent. Even if their customer services department want to help you, they are hindered in doing so. I wish that BANK_NAME would put 5% of the effort they put into ducking issues into sorting them out and they would be much better."
Customer_580, Awful ," Been on the phone 1 hour and 15 mins - still not sorted ..... been with BANK_NAME since 1974 definitely time for a change, their aftercare/costumer service is non existant. .. very poor!! "
Customer_581, International payment horror ," BANK_NAME blocked one of my international payments with the consequence that I almost lost a property bid. And with no explanation whatsoever. I tried calling them multiple times only to end up with clueless staff who couldn't answer why the transfer was blocked or what to do to sort out the problem, spent hours on the phone, A horrible experience, I feel so UNSAFE having BANK_NAME handle my money. Avoid this bank at all cost, I will be closing my accounts as soon as possible,- Horrible telephone service waiting times- Clueless staff who themselves have to call around (spending time in phone ques) to figure out what's going on- Dangerously poor IT systems and fragmented organisation -Where is the regulator!!? "
Customer_582, Rubish customer service ," I had some Unauthorised transaction, but BANK_NAME would not help me to get my money back, they said I have to contact myself personally to this company who took money from my account!!? Are you joking? What kind of bank it's this? Bank suppose to help you get your money back when there are fraudulent activities!!! I am moving bank once this is sorted, unhelpful and rude customer service even worst customer service from the branch!! Absolutely avoid this bank!!! Ps: if I could I would not give them even 1 star!

Customer_583, So unfortunate ," After 17 years of them making money off you, toy get treated with contempt while they do what they want with your money n doubt breaking at least more than one ethical banking code. So so sad... Won't be going back that's for sure. "
Customer_584, Goes beyond poor service. BANK_NAME treats customers with contempt ," We tried to bank with BANK_NAME for about 2 1/2 years. I travel for business and almost everytime I try to get money abroad, my card is declined and put on hold. I spent hours on the phone on multiple occasions trying to resolve the issue. I've been told that the fraud team flags suspicious uses of the card. Presumably every use of the card outside of the UK is suspicious. I've tried calling them to tell them I'm travelling and have been told that it's not neccersary and there is nothing the call center staff can do to alert the fraud team to not cancel my card.All they tell me is that if there's suspicious activity they'll send me a text message. I do get these text messages a day or two after my card has been blocked. I've been left without money abroad and had my card declined at hotels.Whenever I call I'm transfered multiple times and kept on hold, with calls often taking over an hour.For other customer service requests, I find that it often takes multiple hours to get simple things done as I have to talk call center reps through every step of what I need and wait on the phone while they do it. If I leave anything with them, it does not get done. bank_name have no respect for their customers time and openly treat them with contempt.If you're looking for a bank, go elsewhere. "
Customer_585, BANK_NAME business account ," Well, for those of you that are thinking of taking out a BANK_NAME business account; DONT touch even with the proverbial barge pole!!!. BANK_NAME are completely incompetent in the extreme and as such should be avoided if you value your sanity!My problem began recently when out of the blue I received a letter from BANK_NAME stating that I owed them £3600 on a business bank account that I haven't used in over 2 years. I was completely surprised at this as my business partner had put the account on hold over 2 years previous. The account at that time was left in credit, with no direct debits or standing orders. There was also no communication of any kind from the bank over this period!As our business cards had expired, I had no access to the online banking function to interrogate what had taken place sooo, I began the excruciatingly painful exercise of phoning customer service for business banking to see if they could help!!!!Well I went through all the menus and submenus and eventually I was put on hold for 40mins until finally a woman answered my call. I explained the situation to her at length and then she then asked me a few security questions, address, postcode, Rob, mothers maiden name which were all satisfactorily answered! She then asked what was the most recent transaction on the account, to which I replied that there wasn't one as the account hadn't been used in over 2 years, to which she replied that she couldn't help me any further and that I would need to see a business bank manager!!!! I asked her where I could do this and after 5 mins on hold she returned and said that I could do this at my local branch in Esher, Surrey......Okay fast forward and I'm now in a queue at this branch, with 2 cashiers at the till. 20 mins later I'm on and I ask to see the branches business manager...... to which, yes you've guessed it, there isn't one!!!So not to be defeated, I explain the situation and she  points to a phone that resides next to where people are queuing and says that I can ring customer service from there. I explain that this is no good and won't work as I have already tried that at home and that they sent me here! I also point out (and this is truly unbelievable) that I'm not going to be using the phone as it is in a totally unacceptable position and lacks any kind of privacy! I mean come on, do Barays really expect their customers to have a private conversation, whilst having to divulge personal security details etc next to a queue of people that you don't know!!!! GOOD GOD!!!!  Oh and readers you might like to know that there was a poster next to this phone saying beware of scams and not to divulge personal information!!! Truly guys, you couldn't make this up in a million years!!!Anyway,I digress, so anyway, I stand my ground and ask the teller if there's any chance that she could print out statements relating to the said account to which there was a resounding no!!!  So okay, can I book to see a business manager at another branch.... Well the nearest branch as it turns out is in Kingston but apparently he's not there very often as he h a s to flit between several branches..... and that I will have to phone customer service to arrange this!!!!! Argghhh I now begin to realise that I've two hopes of achieving this, Bob Hope and No Hope!!!So again, I dig deep and ask if there's anything they can do what so ever as im desperate and I need to understand what's going on with this business account. Okay, so the teller disappears for 5 mins and comes back to say that if I give them my email address and phone number, she c a n get someone to contact me who can resolve my situation.Soooo once again I'm asked all the security questions and personal details a t the teller point, where I'm clearly within earshot of any suspecting eaves droplets, but hey ho,I'm just to depressed now to even point this out and gladly go through the motions!So anyway, good news as at least after almost 1 hour at the teller point, I leave, assured that someone will contact me and resolve my issue!!!Well I waited and nothing the next day on email or by phone..... nor the next day.... but guess what, Its a Friday and i find a message on my mobile phone answer box and guess what readers...... it's some young lass from BANK_NAME returning my request and she gives me a number to phone and hopes that this saves my problem....... and the number pizzas,Yes of course, it's the first number I used.... customer services!!!!!!!Anyway, have now decided to completely ignore this issue now and they can go sing !!!!It is absolutely clear that this bank is completely incompetent and I'm off to get a lobotomy!!!!P.S. if I could have given less than one star, I would have!

Customer_586," Internet banking disappeared, no recourse for two weeks! "," My husband and I run a small business and have used BANK_NAME's for over a year with lackluster service but no serious problems until yesterday when our account suddenly disappeared from the BANK_NAME's site.  The first person we talked to on the site said they could find no record of our account so it must have been closed.  Panicking over the idea of losing our entire balance of £80,000, my husband rushed to the branch.  Our account is still intact, thank god, but our access to internet banking has been cut off and they won't tell us why.  They say we have to speak to our business manager and the next appoint is not for two weeks.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  We're just supposed to tell our suppliers to wait two weeks before we can wire them payments because BANK_NAME's screwed up??  My husband is sitting at the branch right now and won't leave until the issue is fixed, but you can bet we're also looking for any other bank to move our business to.  I'd sooner keep my money in my mattress than at this bank for a second longer than I have to. "
Customer_587, Always a good experience , Been with BANK_NAME for nearly 3 years and I have always been happy with their services. Can't say I would go with any other bank soon 
Customer_588, 15 minutes to answer my call?? ," I have a start-up company and it's taken BANK_NAME 15 minutes to answer my call! I asked the customer assistant (nicely) why it took so long, and of course she had a well-trained 'we have a high volume today', however I had the same experience a few weeks ago. She came back to me at 22 minutes and did what I asked her to do (finally - just one request to change my pricing plan to e-Payments!). Good grief - the total time for this call was 33 minutes - and guess what  - I'm still on hold as I type this note!  LOL ! What a joke!Call themselves a business! "

Customer_59,Just Don't," I've been a loyal customer of BANK_NAME Business for in excess of 25 years, there has been a fundamental  change in their attitude towards small businesses in the past three years. Small businesses are nothing but an inconvenience to them these days.   They are unhelpful and simply do not give a damn, loyalty to long term customers , it would seem, does not exist in this organisation."
Customer_590, Staff Member accused me of lying when trying to open an account. Unbelievable. ," A staff member had the audacity to accuse me of lying when I was in the process of applying for an account. I wanted to open a second current account as I wanted an account for purchases that was seperate from my account for bills etc. I already have an account with another bank so I thought why not try a different bank, see how the service is. Haha, boy, was I in for a shock. So I applied online for a BANK_NAME account and went into branch...I waited 40 minutes to see someone and I had brought with me relevant ID and wageslips. During the interview to open a current account, she looked at the wage slips, looked up at me and said and I quote:''So, you're sure these are genuine?'' At which point I replied, ''Yes? I got my boss to print them earlier?'' And then unbelieveably, she followed up with... ''What, you can just walk in and do that? You can just do that, can you? I didn't know that'' She then repeated this to the point it became uncomfortable for me and her, and I genuinely didn't even know how to respond to this, the tone of voice she used was similar to that of an angry police officer. I felt like I was being accused of something when all I was trying to do was open an account and switch to BANK_NAME. I've never experienced an employee of any company being so rude in my entire life. And it didn't end there... Oh, no. She then told me I wouldn't be able to open an account unless I transferred existing direct debits and started having my wages paid into the account, which makes absolutely no sense at all since I only wanted an account to use for purchases. I think I'll stick with my old bank and look elsewhere.Absolutely horrific customer service. What is this a police interview? Have I committed a crime? Whoever hired this person quite obviously did so to meet a specific quota. I walked away feeling genuinely offended and angry. "

Customer_596, Extremely poor ," Shocking customer service. I've been trying to book an appointment to open kids bank account for my son. I have waisted a whole day after going to Stratford Westfield branch and ringing customer service speaking to 3 different advisors, that can barely show interest in helping me open an account, I still wasn't able to book an appointment. I will definitely be changing my bank and will advise this to my family members and friends. "
Customer_597, Charges on charges - impossible loop ," This isn't a personal experience from my own bank account but my other half and what I saw from helping them and their bank account.They were in the red each month and when they finally came to me for help to pay a bill I was astounded! They had a £3.5k overdraft as well as a £1000 reserve as well as a £4k credit card and £8k loan.  Everything was maxed out and the charges just keep wiping out any progress made. I looked at the accounts and saw that the loan had been upped from £6k only a few months before.  Totally irresponsible lending and profiteering company.  As soon as the CC was being worked to pay down more than the monthly minimum they got a letter saying their credit limit had been increased - Totally unreal!Needless to say, I paid chunks off and they paid me back in full and now all the BANK_NAME accounts are closed (still took 2.5 years) apart from the loan that has front loaded interest so it made no difference to close that account as you still have the pay the same amount back regardless! "
Customer_598, Worst bank bar none. ," It would seem the BANK_NAME owners are more interested in riddling their branches with machines & any interest at all in customer service has been long lost in a mess of new branch procedures.

Luckily I only have to visit BANK_NAME for business banking - never in a million years would i ever hold a personal account with this bank. "

Customer_617, UNACCEPTABLE RACIST SISTEM / EXPERIENCE ," I have been trying to open a bank account in BANK_NAME for more than one month. The costumer service in  Crouch End LONDON was horrible and the Girl trated me soo bad. I am and European Student and actually they almost ask me a VISA and a SPONSOR. I get that English people don't feel themselves inside the European country, but I cannot accept that the costumer service handle with EU citizens as the were immigrants as we live in the same community.ANyway I had a second appointement booked, that they cancel because they have trouble with some machines, and the people hadling my procedure said she would call me back for another appointment ... NEVER RECEIVE THAT CALL.So I had to book again an appointment throug their PHONE COSTUMER SERVICE which was horrible the first two time, where they wanted to book me an appointment after three weeks, and at the end I found finally someone who booked for me an appointment immediately. today WITH TWO OFFICIAL ID DOCUMENT, a PASSPORT AND AN IDENTITY CARD I COULDN'T OPEN MY ACCOUNT as they won't accept my passport as they couldn't check it"" and my ID because is not in plastic ( AND ACTUALLY I WON'T NEED A PASSPORT TO TRAVEL OR LIVE IN UK AS EUROPEAN SO MY ID SHOULD BE ACCEPTED EVERYWHERE AS OFFICIAL DOCUMENT) I can't receive money from my work as I don't have a bank account AFTER ONE MOTNH AFTER APPLICATION.MY experience is really frustrating and horrible since now.

Customer_618, Worst bank ever. , I made a website to share my story.BANK_NAMEbankreview.com 
Customer_619," Efficient service, dealt with sympathetically "," Regarding a bereavement case, I visited a branch on 2 occasions. Both times to verify original documentation, received response within days. Always helps to not have to worry about whether your requests are being actioned. Even got a PPI refund on the deceased account without having to make a claim. Really pleased and grateful that the service was so efficient! "
Customer_62,BANK_NAME bank in chadwell heath essex," BANK_NAME bank in chadwell heath essex is rubbish. I try to pay money to my sister account and they ask about my details account, i provide, but now only transfer is accepted, you cant pay any money in cashier in banks to someone account!  No sense! Uk to much want to control people! Where is the democracy  that brexiteers talking! This is manipulation! BANK_NAME is worst bank today. Bankers was always busteds!"
Customer_620, Horrific - Telephone customer service is the worst , I cant find words and Im shaking I just want to scream at them 
Customer_621, UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! ," I went to BANK_NAME !!!!<<5>>!!!!! times to open a bank account! One time they wouldn't accept my id from greece which is european id and they shouldn't have any problem, i went there with passport and they wouldnt accept my NINO cause it was a photocopy, i went with the actual paper and they wouldnt accept it because it was expired""! How can a national insurance number be expired when i only applied for it 4 months ago. Unbelievable"
Customer_622, Unacceptable ," I couldn't access my online account. I called twice, both times, it took several re-directs and about 20-30 minutes on hold. The first time, when I finally reached someone, they took me some security questions where they asked me about street names and individuals that I am supposed to know (who they somehow know that I know). I failed and was determined to be, not in fact myself and was not permitted to try again on the same day. A couple days later, I called in again and after another 30 minutes on hold, it was determined my account had been locked"
Customer_623, Useless ," Seriously useless. Never answer the phone, on hold for ages (30mins+) and when you do get through, you get through to India or somewhere. the person does not understand your problem even though you try to explain. You are passed from pillar to post with out and explanation as to why or to the person who eventually takes your call. I cannot run a business like this!! "
Customer_624, Diabolical ," This bank really doesn't care about there customers.  I urgently needed a new pin sentry for online access, I contacted customer services online but I was told I needed to get to a high street branch which was not possible as BANK_NAME had shut my towns branch. I sent BANK_NAME a complaint and later received a email saying the pin sentry device was being sent by post and would arrive within 5days,  12 days and still waiting.  I really do advise everyone complaining about BANK_NAME to change banks. It is really easy to do as the transfer bank takes care of moving all your direct debits etc. And there is a cash incentive of £125 with some of the best rated banks such as first direct.  This is the only thing BANK_NAME understands LOSING MONEY NOT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. "
Customer_625, BANK_NAME Staines. ," Very poor service. No receptionist. You feel lost the moment you went in. Nobody to welcome you, show you where to wait or even say you will be attended soon. You just find your own space to sit down, you keep looking at staffs passing by but not even a single word from them. Was this trained staff? What a disgusting service. Train your employees! I didn't expected this for such a famous bank. "
Customer_626, IAN CANTS - please read this ," Can I just say how disgusted I am with BANK_NAME. I have been a loyal customer for several years. Firstly, my main issue is that I requested via telephone to change my account from a current account plus to a current account. Then, I realised that I was still been charged for that account several months later. Then, whilst speaking to one of your customer service advisors, a lady changed my current account plus to a standard account. She failed to mention any of the terms and conditions and as a result I got heavily into my overdraft. I opened a complaint with the complaints department and after a great deal of effort, I was able to obtain a refund. I was also promised a refund for my phone bill due to spending hours on the phone. This was back in August. I waited a few weeks to receive my £40.00 I was owed for the telephone call. Then, I rang up again and I was transferred to someone by the name of Ian Cants in the complaints department - he is a senior colleague apparently. He told me that he would give me a refund if I emailed him with a copy of my bill. I did this immediately. It is now the 19th of October and I still have not received my £40 refund for my phone costs. I have rung up BANK_NAME on numerous times asking for answers and I have been promised phone calls which have not happened. This evening - I decided to give it one more shot before I permanently close my account. I got through to the complaints department after 1 hour only to be told that there is no notes on my account in regards to the £40 refund for my cost. Regardless, the gentleman I spoke to opened up a new complaint and was about to refund me the £40. Suddenly, after being on hold for 30 minutes - the phone was disconnected.I ring up again - this time waiting 30 minutes to get through the complaints department. I had to explain the complaint all over again in regards to my £40 phone bill. I explained to the lady that I had spoken to Ian Cants. She put me on hold and apparently went to speak to him. She comes back on the phone and claims that Ian Cants has no recollection of speaking to me and they will not be able to refund me the money. What I find disgusting is that no staff in BANK_NAME seem to record the conversations they have with their customers. After 6 years, it looks like I will be going to find another bank - but I am disgusted - especially to the woman I spoke to in the complaints department who claimed I had been untruthful and seemed to be making the whole situation up!Please sort this out BANK_NAME or you will lose ALL of your customers. "
Customer_627, BANK_NAME cheated me out of £3000.00 ," When my late mum left me some money ,i wanted to buy a little place in Spain that i in turn could pass onto my children ,I asked BANK_NAME Bank to change it into euros the rate at the time was 1.64 to the pound, i was promised this in branch,when i collected my 101k of euros they said the person had left the bank,I was £3000.00p short of Euros , i tried and tried over the years to get answers without luck then it came out BANK_NAME had been fiddling for years. I reported this on 1st June this year and still getting fobbed off, with comments it with head office then its with legal dept. please dont let BANK_NAME Bank cheat you. David. "
Customer_628, Worst Customer Service ," Had my wallet stolen and had to ring all my banks to cancel cards, including First Direct, Halifax and Ulster Bank. Of all of them, BANK_NAME are the worst to deal with by a long way. Rude, unhelpful staff who speak poor English and present too many hoops to jump through. Only thing to get me through security is to have memorised transactions on my account - as if people do that. So I'm stuck without a card and access to my account. Compared to first direct: English operator answered in one ring and within 2 mins promised a new card in 2 days! If the others can do it why cant you BANK_NAME? You've made a very unpleasant experience even worse. Looking to move my current account away from you. "
Customer_629, Terrible customer service , Only wanted to change my name and BANK_NAME made this almost impossible. I also bank with several other banks and the for the other banks all I had to do was go into store with the right documents and they did it there and then. With BANK_NAME I was told I needed an appointment and there was a 2 week waiting list!!! I made an appointment for two weeks time and then when I arrived they had no record of my appointment!! Ridiculous process for what should be a very straightforward change. 
Customer_63, Helpful staff apps pretty decent always … , Helpful staff apps pretty decent always let you know through the app any changes to account money in or out etc 
Customer_630, Customer service terrible as usual , I've been banking with BANK_NAME for 8 years. 8 years of terrible customer service over the phone and shocking interest rates on products they offer me although I've been behaving like a model citizen when it comes to managing my finances for years. 
Customer_631, Terrible customer service - again! ," I have just got off yet another very long and fruitless call from the BANK_NAME team. I'm sure BANK_NAME would love to have all my cash accumulating in their coffers, but I don't trust them an inch with it! Whilst I always speak to someone who is pleasant and polite, my call is always transferred to an overseas call centre. The operatives have clearly not been trained and don't have access to all of the systems they need to be able to give out the correct information, which results in misinformation and frustration. I feel sorry for them, as they have clearly been given a script to read and are helpless to try and resolve any issues that aren't straightforward, and therefore correctly advise customers. The end result is a very unhappy banking customer and a call to the complaints team...time and time again! I am now looking at other banks, or possibly to just move everything to my building society who actually care about giving their customers a good service, and aren't so complacent to think that customers won't vote with their feet. Beware of BANK_NAME, there is a reason they do not rate well in customer polls! "
Customer_632, Several chances given - BANK_NAME SERVICE UNACCEPTABLE ," To be honest I wouldn't even give it any stars. I gave several chances for BANK_NAME but it is just not meant to be. I tried to open a bank account, first one in the UK as I am new to the country. In the beginning it was very hard to get a proof of address that was accepted by the bank, but that is generally like that in UK. The first disappointment was with BANK_NAME Customer support. I booked an appointment over the phone for a Saturday, they offered me several options, I picked one and put it into my calendar 3 weeks in advance. The operator was about to give me reference number, I asked him to wait for a time so I can write it, he said it is not that important so he basically pushed me to end the call. When I went to my long avaited appointment it turned out that he booked it an hour earlier. He also didn't send any confirmation. I had to rebook, now for two days later. I took off time from work, went to the bank, I brought my letter from NINO office for proof of address that was previously checked by a receptionist at one BANK_NAME and customer support also confirmed that it works as proof of address. At the appointment they told me that it is a temporary NI number so it does not work. I rebooked the appointment again.Finally I got to the Cheapside branch with Ryan Sparrowhawk. It went fast, in fact Ryan didn't care much to provide information in a way, he seemed to push the apointment. After completing a form he sent me off that I will get a call back within 4 hours with my account details. I didn't. I called Customer support the next day, I was asked when my application was submitted. I told them I have opened a bank account yesterday. The cust. sup. representative said the account is not active yet, btw asked me ' Hey mam, if you applied yesterday, how do you expect to have a card today' - I was asking my account details, not the card. Not to mention how rude he was. This was three weeks ago, still haven't heard from it.In the meanwhile I opened an account with TSb two days after I called BANK_NAME Customer Support asking about my account details.My partner also had bad experience with them and I would highly recommend to pick any bank but BANK_NAME. They should invest more into customer support, training employees, processing applications - basically service - rather than marketing and ads. "
Customer_633, It's no better by email or post! ," Wanting online access to a charity's bank statements I approached the local branch, who couldn't help but gave me an email address.  Two attempts by that route produced no response so I wrote to Customer Services in Leicester - well who would want the frustration of the call centre - but two letters have produced no answer either.  Next stop another bank. "
Customer_634, True Nightmare ," Words can never describe my frustration of this terrible place. They are incompetent and terrible company. I noticed that I was being double charged for the same items on my statement. When I called on the weekend the agent advised that I call on Monday because that"" department was closed. I called on Monday and basically I wasted my whole day going in circle between agents and departments and getting my calls disconnected with them. At the end and after I wasted my day I asked to speak with a manager. She finally fixed the issue. On Tuesday I noticed another charge was still not fixed so I called again and another manager transferred me to another department that they promised to have this issue fixed. I WILL NEVER USE THIS CARD OR ATTEMPT TO USE ANYTHING RELATING TO BANK_NAME. STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!! """
Customer_635, Terrible company with incredibly bad customer support ," I wanted to transfer some money from my account to another payee. What I thought would take half an hour or so online, took the best part of an afternoon and morning due to misinformation from several members of telephone banking/branch staff. During the last phone call I actually cried because the process had become so frustrating. I'll be transferring my money to a new bank that cares about its customers as soon as I am able to. That's if it doesn't take another few hours for a bunch of incompetent idiots to help with a simple task. "
Customer_636, Unusable Account ," We transferred our company accounts to BANK_NAME Business in March 2015. We then went through a long process (2 months work) of changing our details for invoice with all our clients (around 80). Money started going in to the account, however, there was one significant floor - we couldn't transfer any money out. I have spent 40 hours over the last four weeks on the phone to BANK_NAME and probably the same the month before. Our business manager in Birmingham (Mike Falkner) completely washed his hands of the issue saying we needed to deal with the online team.Today 16th September we have been informed there is a glitch in the system and BANK_NAME do not know how/when this will be resolved and they have advised that we close our account and go back to Santander. This answer was only achieved after four hours of arguing and had they had their way the glitch would still be undiscovered.We estimate our loss at around 20k and that is before we go through the process of changing back to Santander and updating our clients. A formal complaint has been raised and they expect to come back to us in eight weeks.If you are a business thinking of switching to BANK_NAME approach with extreme caution and don't change anything until you have tested your account for at least three months.Also like most others we have experienced the expected misinformation, rudeness, inept managers etc. These issues are not isolated, this is a systemic problem running through the core of BANK_NAME. They are aware and don't care. "
Customer_637, Fraud on online services , I am dealing with barlcys with a case of money being stolen from my account after 9 meetings and 4 weeks still no refund when they promises online that they will refund. Can't say how bad they have treated me. 
Customer_638, Utterly Rude and disrespectful ," I called the customer service line through my banking app in order to set up a new payee, after confirming my security details several times I was told that I couldn't set up a new payee using the phone banking and that I should do it online with my pinsetry. As I was at work and didn't have my pinsetry with me this was obviously not possible. As I needed to make the payment immediately due to an emergency waiting until I get home wasn't an option. When I asked for an alternative the customer service adviser told me I should withdraw cash from a machine and give it to the payee in cash!!!!! Really?? Worst customer experience ever. I'm definitely changing banks. "
Customer_639, Nightmare Organisation ," I have never in 28 years of buying and selling properties and dealing with mortgage applications ever come across such a shambles of an organisation. From losing all our supporting application documents. Letting us think that the they had everything they needed to make an offer. Then A week later finding out that the application has been put on hold because they need more documentation. But no-one can clarify what it is that they need that they don't already have. Being kept on hold for 25 mins at a time, promises to call back  not materialising. To the broker intervening by getting their area business development manager involved who himself in addition to the under-writers dealing with the application is also not responding to our calls. This application has been in play 9 weeks. I am 24 hours away from losing £1,000 reservation deposit because of their incompetence. I would recommend never ever  applying for a Woolwich mortgage from BANK_NAME. "
Customer_64, Smart Investor True review is no stars ," Smart Investor: True review is no stars.  More expensive, cannot hold certain shares I have. I am still waiting for transfer to complete despite requesting August 2018.  Have wasted days worth of hours on the phone. "
Customer_640, They simply do not care ," I've had an account with BANK_NAME for over 12 years, I've never gone overdrawn once, I wanted to request a £100 overdraft, couldnt do it online so used the online chat service, I was told as I had taken a payday loan within the last year my account was blocked from being allowed an overdraft!I'd taken out a £200 payday loan and paid it back within 3 days due to a car emergency.Blocking customers as standard policy is nothing but rude, the person 'clair' who was supposed to be customer friendly was nothing but blunt and rude, she even told me id asked why I wasn't allowed an overdraft, My question was why cant I apply online for one.I've now applied online with another bank and moving my services elsewhere, 12 years loyalty has only gained me to feel stupid for staying with BANK_NAME. "
Customer_641, Counter staff make mistakes ," I had over 2k  taken in error from my current account by a member of staff who was supposed to be taking it from savings! Result was we were overdrawn for the first and only time due to BANK_NAME's own mistakes. Problem was put right when I went in, very upset and complained and charges were reimbursed. Personal banker was very good but counter staff very defensive bordering on rude! Since then I have had to ensure I repeat myself and get confirmation of everything I ask them to do, in any branch and have still had to endure misunderstandings, lack of attention to detail and poor, careless staff just short of making more mistakes. "
Customer_642, Changes to Online Banking Functionality , BANK_NAME unilateral decision to remove the ability to download multiple account statements simultaneously is a hugely counter productive step for business owners and personal customers alike. People now have to complete several downloads instead of one. Not very smart thinking BANK_NAME! Time to look for another account. Tried to complain but the complaints team were useless. Totally ineffective customer service BANK_NAME - SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH. 
Customer_643, Terrible customer service ," If you enjoy rude customer assistants, a website that is fundamentally unreliable, a pinsentry device that does not work thus preventing you from logging on to your account, lousy interest rates, having paymenst blocked for no reason and no explanation given then bank with BANK_NAME. I do not so I shall leave. "
Customer_644, Lousy customer service ," My husbands card was frozen even though the funds were readily available in our joint account. Banked with BANK_NAME over forty years! Had to call fraud team offshore so many times to be told, it's ok now. Well it isn't! Time to switch to a company that values its customers and gas a UK call centre! "
Customer_645, Utterly terrible ," Basically, nobody on the end of the phone knows how to do their job properly. Endless waiting, misinformation and empty promises. "
Customer_646, bad customer service!!! ," worst customer care ever - get put on hold for up to 20 minutes at a time to be transferred to another person to ask same security questions over again and then put on hold again. My  debit card not working when ordering online, so now i had to wait for them to send me another one. They telling me that is nothing wrong with my card, but I still can`t place order online. ..SOOOOO anoing! "
Customer_647, replacement card services wasting customer time , Ordered a new card on the phone. Told ready for pick up next day.  Went to bank at lunchtime to be greeted by a sea of machines and all cashier booths removed. After a wait of 30mins I'm told have to arrive at 2:30.   explained im leaving the country next day and manager shrugs and says they give incorrect advice on the phone.  Why bother with BANK_NAME time to switch. 
Customer_648, Useless! ," Unhelpful bank... Phoned up for an account problem and over a space of 3 days i was told 7 different things. I visited the branch in the end and was told i could be helped, all i needed was my passport.  Went home and returned to be told theres nothing they can do. Just forget BANK_NAME they great till you have a issuee and then they are rubbish. "
Customer_649, Rude unhelpful and useless internet banking and call centre , worst customer care ever - get put on hold for up to 20 minutes at a time to be transferred to another person to ask same security questions over again and then put on hold again. Then to be told the transaction will be processes to find that it has not. I will be moving yo another bank very soon.Giving one star is being over generous - minus would be more accurate 
Customer_65, Very bad and unhelpful customer … ," Very bad and useless, unhelpful customer service.  If you want peace in your life and business, dont ever open a BANK_NAME business account.  The day you need help, you will have the nightmare of your life.  They are useless, untrained and they just disconnect your call and they dont call you again.  Typical of a third world service. Mary "
Customer_650, ALWAYS F***ING HANG UP ON ME!!! , SO RUDE AND ANNOYING. Im going to metro bank. 
Customer_651, FUC*K YOU BANK_NAME! ," Website, log in, and everything what i try to settle is a problem ! "
Customer_652, BANK_NAME business account fraud attempt , We have a business account with BANK_NAME Bank and this has been in operation since December 2012.Last week a fraudster managed to get our telephone banking pass code and managed to set up a payee on our account. We do not understand how BANK_NAME staff stated that we must have been careless with our pass code when we have never used the system.Secondly the fraudster tried to transfer £900 which was stopped. But instead of helping us BANK_NAME has frozen all our online banking and mobile banking until they establish how the leak happened. They have not communicated how long it will take to rectify the issue but when we rang the fraud team an irate lady told us that it can take up to 20 working days. Is this reasonable in this day and age. We are suffering because we have no way of checking whether the clients have transferred their payments and we cannot release the service. In last week our turnover has dropped by 70%. We put in a complaint to BANK_NAME but once again an irate gent rang us and told us that until the investigation is done to establish where the leak is from we cannot do anything about it. He said that BANK_NAME is trying to protect our money. 
Customer_653, Scamster and Fraudster Haven and Refuge!! ," Tomas Rahm, Jesse Rodriguez!!!! Recognise these names BANK_NAME? U should because your bank has provided accounts for these two aliases who are scamming openly on TROVIT in Australia selling cars and then not delivering. These two supposed gentlemen are one in the same and have ripped me off to the tune of $19000 sent to your bank in Lupton! Your fraud investigators have returned a we can't do anything verdict"" and have no intention of returning my money and vehemently protected the account holder known as Tomas Rahm here in Australia who poses as a soldier on assignment to Afghanistan and in a hurry to sell his car. Unfortunately I was stung big time and now have to explain to my family why some other thieving low life has our money!   BANK_NAME Bank service is lousy even when you can find someone who can speak some form of English"
Customer_654, BANK_NAME website always down when you need it most ," really poor from such a big bank, have had a few nightmare experiences that really should have been avoided..... "
Customer_655, Poorest customer service , Twice I've phoned up before I go on holiday to advise I'll be out of the country and possibly using my card. Twice BANK_NAME have blocked my card. Twice I've had to call up from abroad and wait on hold for at least 45 minutes to get resolved. 
Customer_656, Can't use mobile banking on rooted android device ," I've had a BANK_NAME current account for 11 years and a business account for 4 years. I've held a lot of money in that time with BANK_NAME and always been a loyal customer. I heavily rely on the mobile banking app to manage my accounts and to pay people (including MYSELF a salary!). I can no longer do this because I have a rooted phone. What a joke. Rooted devices aren't any less secure than stock devices. In fact, if anything it's more secure thanks to the anti virus and malware apps I can now install because it's rooted.Unfortunately for BANK_NAME, TSB are getting my personal, savings and business accounts and currently in the process of switching them for me. "
Customer_657," Unbelievable! Terrible service, not to mention rumours of them also committing fraud. Should be shut down! ", Thanks to the guy who's just hung up on me on purpose which I knew would happen as soon as I started ringing and it took over 20 minutes for him to answer (great customer service) been hung up on SO MANY TIMES from BANK_NAME Customer services ! What an absolute blimming joke! Employees should be sacked for hanging up on customers or being rude etc. Calls should be monitored in order to prevent such AWFUL Customer service. Will not be staying with this bank any longer I am sick of it! 
Customer_658, No Good for Overseas Travelers ," BANK_NAME Bank cards are rated highly for earning travel awards but heaven help you if you are overseas and need help -- because BANK_NAME's won't.For the second time in two years they have replaced my card (their initiation) without informing me in advance.  They start by postal mailing the new card to my address of record, even though I have informed them in advance of my travel plans.  When I call them to discuss it, they act surprised to find out I am abroad and that I won't be back home to pick up my new card any time soon.Last year I went two months with NO CREDIT CARD at all as I was stranded overseas when they nullified the old card before I received the new one.  They sent three cards to me overseas the first two being useless because they fail to allow for sufficient delivery time.  Then they express surprise when the card does not arrive in time, even though you have told them the amount of delivery delays usually experienced.Just now they have repeated things.  I only now learned they have already mailed a replacement card to my home address, even though they had been previously informed I will be away for months.  They say they'll give me thirty days to use my former card -- let's see if they have any ability to get a new card to me here overseas within that time.  I have my doubts. "
Customer_659, WORST BANK - STAY CLEAR ," I have banked with BANK_NAME for the very last time, the worst service I have ever received. I have never in my life ever experienced such poor level of service. I simply cannot speak to any advisors as they always hang up the phone. The advisors have ridiculed me and then laughed at me whilst I expressed my genuine concerns. I have closed all my bank account with them including my business banking. MY current account is still not closed even after visiting a branch and requesting closer and having this confirmed. Now on top of this they are intending to charge me interest on a 0% balance  ?? how does this even work. I have no alternative but to report these criminals to the FCA. If only I read the review on the Bank before trying there service. I have seen that there are many people experiencing the same problems. STAY WELL CLEAR "
Customer_66, Unflexible and unhelpful ," Unflexible, unhelpful, CS staff do not care about customers, user unfriendly online banking portal, broken app (on my phone at least), bad phone system.Did I need more reasons to switch to a better bank? Glad I did, so far so good. "
Customer_660, Cannot even get my latest statement ," So many options, so many changes of latest look, I dont even know if Im still on the same website .... now I cannot even get my latest statement????? Is it THAT complicated??? "
Customer_661, foreign exchange , Terrible rates and unable to cancel - choose another company.  For £800.00 we lost out at least £50.00 worth of euros had we gone with the best online interest rate - we will not use BANK_NAME again for foreign exchange.  Next time will go with trust-pilot reviewed best rate company. 
Customer_662, Lying to customers! , I find it appalling that you find it acceptable for your staff to lie to customers as long as they do not put it in writing! It's absolutely disgusting! 
Customer_663, Bad bad bad bad service. ," Ok so today I wake up to find my account overdrawn. On Friday my aunt paid in a cheque for a large amount for my birthday which is very soon. When I ring the useless mangers call centre staff, based in India ha ha. To be told you will not be able to access any money from you account till the cheques is clear. So let me get this straight someone pays a cheque into your account and then the bank stops you getting to any money you did have in there. To protect you, what a joke. But hey it's ok for there ceo's to commit fraud which they have now sacked to mention no names. So a bank the is happy to commit fraud, then accuses you of it and stops you getting your money to protect you. As soon as I have my money BANK_NAME can take a run and jump my account will closed. I would say to anyone thinking of joining them to think twice. Yes you get a nice swanky personalised card but good is that if you can't get your money. Or pay for things in a shop. Not to mention the embarrassment. when it's declined.Enough said......... "
Customer_664, a complete nightmare , worst experience ever. had to prove my address. I have send them my proof of address three times. they are still not convinced. All those monkeys are constantly telling you the same things. nobody is actually listening. Feels like you are talking to some kind of robots. 
Customer_665, Awful Telephone Banking Service , I recently lost my debit card whilst out shopping. It took me 45 minutes to get through the automated telephone system to report the card list and put a stop on it. When I finally got through to the right department because I was unable to give an exact amount of a recent direct debit (only out by £25) he was unable to process the request and was so condescending in his attitude I gave up trying. Drove to the Walthamstow BANK_NAME who put a stop on my card immediately. Absolutely terrible experience of telephone banking service. 
Customer_666, Mortgage with BANK_NAME Bank Spain (now Caixa Bank) ," 10 years ago I purchased in Spain using BANK_NAME Bank Spain for a mortgage. AFTER A YEAR I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM VALENCIA THAT MY PROPERTY WAS ILLEGAL and must be demolished. A SECOND letter arrived some time later informing me that it was my responsibility to demolish my house. I asked the bank for my documents and the INITIAL SURVEY was MISSING. It took me a long time to get this document as BANK_NAME Spain refused me access until I went to the EU.MY PROPERTY WAS AND STILL IS ILLEGAL and this is CLEARLY stated on my Initial Survey. I wrote to Varley, Agius, Diamond, Walker and to this day I never had an acknowledgement or reply.TWO of my letters via Varley and Diamond were sent to Spain for them to investigate themselves and they said the mortgage was given on the architects cert. as it said that my property was OVER FIVE years old and was protected by Spain's Aitiquity law BUT MY INITIAL SURVEY CLEARLY SHOWS THE OPPOSITE saying that my property was NEW and not protected by this law. Also the property had no permission to build"

Customer_669, Terrible service ," I have tried for the unmpteenth time to process a transfer of funds from my account to my son's account in France, using online banking service. The first time it would not accept the full SWIFT 11 digit code so, following a look for information on the internet I entered the first 8 digits, which was validated by online banking. The process was not smooth as it kept freezing and I had to start the process over several times. Once complete the funds went out of my account but were returned next day. My local branch informed me that I should have used a 6 digit SWIFT code for France. They also advised that for this kind of transaction I go into the branch. Really!! What is the point of online baking then? On return home I tried again. It would not accept 6 digits so phoned bank. Whilst on hold I tried entering the full 11 digits and this time it was validated. Telephone banking said I will not get my fee of £15 returned as I should have used 11 digits in the first place. When I explained that it came up with an error with 11 digits on several attempts he then tried to blame the problem on the French bank. I asked to be put through to complaints as I felt any other business would give a refund for faulty services. Whilst on hold for an eternity, I typed in a complaint on the online system as I had run out of time and needed to go to work. Over the years I have had to complain 3 times to BANK_NAME and in each occasion my complaint was not dealt with despite several attempts on my part. I would not recommend anyone bank with BANK_NAME and I am changing banks shortly. "
Customer_67, Bereavement Team ," As an executor of a will, made an appointment with all documents needed to close account one week later the bereavement team say no sign of any papers from branch so probably lost.  Have read online this is a regular occurrence. "
Customer_670, Wood green BANK_NAME ," It feels like they are working in slow motion , i am literally waiting 40 min to take some money out of my acount and people are leaving the bank with there heads down because of your slow service ... Friday morning and you have only 2 employees omg . "
Customer_671, BANK_NAME ARE TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ," BANK_NAME customer service is atrocious money has left my account due to fraudulent activity I had to fill out numerous forms to get this money back and had to argue with many of your staff, I then got my money and a month later it then gets taken back out of my account, so I then take a trip to speak to a personal banker at my local branch who advised me that he had opened a complaint and if I don't get my money back after a week to call you again, I then phoned again after 1 week and spoke to someone who advised me that I wouldn't be getting the money back as it never left my account even though it shows it on my statement and I had been advised that fraud department had made a mistake and would be refunding this, I then asked for her to get back in touch with the fraud department who I then spoke to and they advised me AGAIN that they were in the wrong and that they will contact the case manager AGAIN so that I can get my money back and I still have not received a call back or my money. I cannot believe that a bank that I have been with for years can treat me so badly and I have truly lost confidence in you. Every time I ask to speak to a manager or someone with authority I get told that they are either not available or in a meeting. This is such a frustrating situation and I feel like I am getting nowhere with it as i just seem to be getting fobbed off every time I call. I hope that people see my message and decide that they wont use you as the people they trust their money with as it just seems that you really don't care about your customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Customer_672, dreadful service ," Sept 2012 I bought  Samsung Tablet and download the BANK_NAME app. For two years or so I used this with no problem, then had a problem with the tablet, meaning I had to reset it, losing everything on it. I therefore had to reload the BANK_NAME app, which was fine, apart from the fact that Icould no longer pay anyone. I made various phone calls, no one could give me the answer, then one person rang me back, saying it was a security thing and after ten days the app would update and once again I would be able topay BANK_NAMEcard etc. After two weeks this had not happened, so more calls and I was told a member of the technical team would call me. No one ever did. XYesterday, 18th June, I went on to the app to be met with a notice telling me I needed to upgrade the app via Play Store or similar. I went into Playstore and the app wasn't there.  Many phone calls and visits to the bank later I have found out that the app is no longer available for use on tablets!! I bought my tablet so that I could use apps, BANK_NAME online banking being the one I used the most. Now the only way I can see my bank details is to go via Google, which is much slower and nowhere near as clear. I am told the only way to get an app again is to buy a smart phone,van ipad or change banks. Having used the app for over two years, why has BANK_NAME made a backward step to penalise android users like this. "
Customer_673, Shockingly Poor Service ," I find it difficult to put into words just how disappointed i am with BANK_NAME Mortgages. We have banked with BANK_NAME for 15 years with no issues but their mortgage application and underwriting service is abysmal! We ran through our mortgage application with an advisor on the phone, based i believe at their Leeds Office, not only has he proved to be near on impossible to reach but the couldn't care less attitude of the front line customer service staff when trying to obtain an update has been really poor. Our application has now been with underwriters for 2 weeks despite the promised timeline of 48hrs, this is partially due to BANK_NAME seemingly being unable to request more than one document at a time, and kindly giving us the wrong address to send our original documents to. I finally thought we had a breakthough yesterday when I rang for an update and was passed to the Underwriters in India it seems. I was told they had all they need and a decision would be made today. I duly called, only to be told that our underwriter isn't there today as the weather is bad...better wait until Monday... "
Customer_674," Complaint after complaint, with no end in sight. "," I hold Power of Attorney for a family member who has an account with BANK_NAME. When I attempted to register the government-verified paperwork with BANK_NAME so that I could manage my family member's account (she has early-stage dementia and lives in a residential home), BANK_NAME made it a very long, drawn-out, and stressful process. I tried calling their Power of Attorney customer service number, only to be told that they would not speak with me because I was not the main account holder (?!). They refused to even acknowledge that they had received the Power of Attorney paperwork/if they were processing it. There was a lot of telephone-based shrugging and passing the buck. I ended up lodging a complaint with the Executive Complaints Team. After many calls and emails, the Power of Attorney was registered.After a few weeks I was issued with online banking access to the account, and telephone banking documentation. I was told that a debit card would be posted out to me. After three further weeks I still had not received the debit card. I emailed BANK_NAME, who did not respond. After a few days I chased the query up, and was told that the card HAD been sent out, but that it had been sent marked for my attention to the residential home that the account holder - the family member I hold Power of Attorney for - resides in (I don't live there....it's a home for old people. I'm 33....). Which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The card never surfaced, and I was forced to contact BANK_NAME again to ask them to cancel the card, just in case it fell into the wrong hands. I'm still not entirely sure that they have cancelled it, and I am without a debit card.I am now experiencing an online banking glitch. I filled out the online banking query form via the online account, and received an email saying that they could not talk to me about the glitch because I was not the account holder and it would not be appropriate"". I was told to call them and that they may be able to help me then. I have just spent 15 minutes on the phone to their online banking team (based in India) and they do not know what the problem is or how to solve it. They were completely clueless. I have been told to expect a call back from their technical team (no timeframe given). Do forgive me"
Customer_675, No Support - They are really bad , This Bank does not deserve its status - although it does desrve its falling reputation. Still locked out of my account after 5 days. They promise to ring back but NEVER do! I will be moving back to Santander... 
Customer_676, Was charging charges for charges!!! ," I used to bank with BANK_NAME over five years ago but was advised to change banks due to a DRO (Debt Relief Order). One of the reasons I started getting into debt was the ever increasing overdraft and unauthorised"" overdraft charges I was getting not to mention the letters which they charge £20 for or whatever the charge is for them. At one point I was paying charges on a charge for another charge and it totalled up to a huge £88/month! I was ALREADY heavily in debt to the bank and I had to miss a rents payment putting my flat at risk. And the online banking is useless. You can only view a few statements to a few months back-unlike BANK_NAME which can go back YEARS!!!Also unlike BANK_NAME"
Customer_677, Awful service ," I had to use the telephone banking services for BANK_NAME I was put on hold for 15 minutes after the lady couldn't help she transferred me to another department the telephone operator knew that he was unable to help but still continued with his useless formalities instead of assisting me in a time of need BANK_NAME hang up on me... Or let's say the call dropped "" ...  I then called again and surprise surprise was put on hold again for 10 minutes ... I was finally able to make a simple transfer ! But it took me a total of 30 minutes "
Customer_678, Unhelpful and lacking proffessional attitudes ," Newport- Isle of Wight branch. Numerous members of my close friends and family have had issues. Over the telephone, one couple were told exactly what they needed to bring to a meeting to open an account. 1× I.D was requested. Upon arriving at the meeting, the useless customer representative said that they needed 2× I.D. When asked if they could print something off, they were told the it had to be printed at home. I'm assuming that the penny it would cost to print it would have put BANK_NAME out of pocket. Either that or the petty manager takes some kind of ego trip from expressing his power over printing arrangements. Either way, a very unprofessional and unhelpful service. Whatever happened to wanting to help people out, I don't know, maybe because it's the nice thing to do?Another incident involved a friend arranging a meeting at the same bank with the same useless representative and upon arrival was told that the representative was off for two weeks. Hollow apologies followed. I would feel dreadful about messing someone about like the and do all I could to put it right. Seems like BANK_NAME Newport branch think it fit to allow a bunch of immature cowboys to handle customers money and accounts. Dispointing to see what the world of customer service is coming to. I'm sure previous generations would be disappointed. I hope to never have the displeasure of dealing with such people. Will spread the word. You see, unprofessionalism doesn't go unnoticed and a bad reputation is hard to lose. In the end, it will be you at BANK_NAME who will lose out. Who will lose. "
Customer_679, Disgusting overdraft chargers , The overdraft chargers are disgusting 75p  a day I see BANK_NAME more as a loan shark or pay day lender than a high street bank in my opinion  you complain they don't listen I have since changed banks 
Customer_68, Left in limbo ," I applied for an account with BANK_NAME and to switch from my current account. I get sent a letter saying they have opened the account. I get an account number and sort code. I go to branch and show ID and switch is confirmed. BANK_NAME issues bank account card, pin, telephone pin, online pin and letter with switch date. Great! Four days later I get a generic letter from BANK_NAME saying they have cannot accept my application for an account. ???!!!I call BANK_NAME and the team I need to speak to have left a note on my account but they have gone home for the day. I call my current bank and they can’t do anything for me as BANK_NAME have to terminate the the switch. This is not how you run a bank. Don’t join them. I am now left in limbo trying to work out where my salary will be paid and if I will even have a bank account at the end of this. "

Customer_681, Jumping through hoops for no reason ," Barlcays online banking .. broken again .. call the help number to quote error code ... 9 minutes of entering information like my sort code etc until I get through to a person.  Then security questions, ok fine.  Then they tell me the problem is resolved, all I need to do is log out and back in again.  I do so, same error and error code, so she says she will arrange for a call back for me from another team.  But before she can authorise my call back (PS this has now been a 15 mins call during my lunch break), she tells me she needs further security .. wants me to tell her about a recent transaction, who it was to and the value ... what? why? Why when BANK_NAME online banking is broken am I the one having to jump through hoops??  Idiot at end of phone does not even understand that if I had hacked this account sufficiently to provide all the information I had already given that providing that extra piece (which merely evidences that I can see the account) is not securing that I am who I say I am!!!  Moronic.  Computer says no.  Don't bother employing people BANK_NAME, these foreign call centres are full of people terrified to use their own initiative, making computers an equally attractive option ... is this the long game you are playing??

Customer_682, Massive queues and long waits. , Had an appointment at 2:30pm at BANK_NAME Brighton. Got there 5 minutes early. Queued for 30 mins before someone told me appointment would be another 15 minutes.This is despite having to book a week ahead and one email and 2 annoying text message reminders.This would be fine if they didn't make me wait 45 minutes! 
Customer_683, Can not access pre-selected offers ," I am a business customer of BANK_NAME and recently enquired about a business loan. The business manager said I had already been pre-approved for a £12,000 loan and if I logged in to my online business account and then clicked on pre-selected offers all I needed to do was answer a couple of questions and that would be all.So I logged on and I clicked on the pre-selected offers  only to see a message to say there was a technical issue with this page and try again in one hour. Well you can guess 36 hours later and the same thing. So I phoned customer services and was told they have been aware of this issue for months they even asked me to use different servers like google chrome and internet explorer but nothing worked in the end they said they had no time frame of when this would be resolved.BANK_NAME are a multi billion pound company and for them not even fix the issue nevermind not knowing when it will be fixed is ridiculous. As a business customer I don't have the time to be on the phone for over an hour for an over the phone application..... Having the £12,000 offer was due to me running my business correctly. Also having previous loans that I paid off within a year, hence them pre-selecting me.In the end I have gone to Paypal who have given me a lone in 15 seconds for the same amount. So well done BANK_NAME absolutely pathetic! "
Customer_684, BANK_NAME bank staff need to review their customer service skills! ," While checking my bank account online noticed a couple of payments had been taken for a company I had never dealt with.  Rang customer services and explained the obvious errors.  The lady was rude, disinterested and at no point did she say my card needed to be cancelled and a new one issued!  She came back on the line after checking my account and during that time the company had taken another payment!!!  She did not know what procedure to take and said I would be making a complaint. I found the company concerned and they said I had to email them any info I had and they would look into it.  I was so annoyed and wondered why it was that I was having to act as go-between, it was not my responsibility!I rang BANK_NAME back and said I was making a formal complaint, including one against the original customer service staff I spoke to.  T he manager was very concerned about the way I had been treated.  He cancelled my card, refunded all monies that were wrongly taken, gave me £25 as an apology and said the member of staff would be investigated. I have been with the bank for over 35 years and realise no one can be trusted - not even banks! "
Customer_685, A2912207 , I have a little problem that why reason are review 
Customer_686, Dishonest banking at its finest ," BANK_NAME were my first ever bank and up to 2007, I remained with them. Initially I had no problem with their services, until I became a student and had a student account. Thereon, three things happened that soured my previously placid view of the bank. I'll explain all three in detail:-------------------------------------------------------1) Mismanagement of my current accountPrior to starting my three-year university course, I'd alerted BANK_NAME to my situation - with all valid paperwork - inside my local branch and the assistant changed my account accordingly. At that time, all student accounts had an option of a £300 fee-free overdraft, which naturally I took up. The new student card and necessary paperwork were sent subsequently. Everything operated as normal until end September 2007, when I was due to start my second year of university. I'd travelled to Scotland for a week a fortnight before resumption and calculated that the overdraft, at the time, would cover me while I waited for pay day from work. However, I was confused when I returned home to a letter from BANK_NAME claiming I was in the red with additional charges. After a few phone calls, the last assistant I spoke to asked me (rather patronisingly) whether when I'd opened my account I 'just assumed' I had an overdraft. Even though I'd already explained I had a student account, I reiterated that fact and - to my horror - she revealed my account was a standard one. When I challenged her on why that had happened when I hadn't finished university, she said nonchalantly she didn't know before suggesting I returned to my branch to re-open my account as a student one. Subsequently, I wrote to BANK_NAME about this incident with a request they refund me for their erroneous overdrawn charges but I never received a reply, nor a refund - or any seeming concern. Eventually I was compelled to close my BANK_NAME account and move my finances elsewhere.2) Deceptive response to fraudMy account had been subject to a card cloning fraud, which I noticed from a statement where two alien items were on there totalling almost £250. I visited my local branch and spoke to an assistant that, after constantly asking if I was 'sure' I hadn’t made those transactions, called the main HQ and afterwards, told me that my card had been blocked and I should fill in some paperwork to send back to them, which I did. While waiting for the outcome of the claims, I received another monthly statement where I saw another alien item had been charged to my account - an account that had since been 'blocked', you say? When I returned to the branch and spoke to another assistant about the new fraudulent payment and my previous branch visit, the assistant appeared shocked that I'd been misinformed and decided to block the card herself in my presence. That time, it had been, I was sent a new card as a result and I got my money back - but I didn't forget having been lied to by the other branch assistant.3) BANK_NAMEcardI also had a credit card with BANK_NAME. However, shortly after I closed my current account and despite me always paying my credit bills well over the payment limit each time and AHEAD of time, BANK_NAME wrote the vaguest letter to me in mankind claiming, to the following effect, that 'after routine inspection of customers' accounts and activities, we've decided to suspend your account. Your limit has been reduced to £0.00 and you should continue making payments to clear your outstanding owing amount.' Upon reading that, immediately I hopped onto online banking and transferred my remaining balance to the credit card of my new bank, as I wasn't to give BANK_NAME any service whatsoever after the rather disrespectful way they managed my accounts. Given how almost immediately this manoeuvre happened after the initial closure, I still suspect it was done out of spite.---------------------------------------------Even if one has been with a company or service for years, that company still has potential to undermine the trust of its customers. Loyalty is not worth a grain of salt and especially with banks such as BANK_NAME, it never will be. As long as they have your money.If you are a new customer or considering switching banks, I would confidently recommend you avoid BANK_NAME. "
Customer_687, New account ," Open a new account and get online banking which works on the first day i use it, then it stops i call up and my account does not exist and i need to go to branch to sort out internet banking??????I call customer services and they are not taking external calls until i rant down the phone. then suddenly they are!But they still cant there back sides with both hands and say i need to go to the branch. and hang up the phone. Just put in for a switch on the account to a new company as i dont want to deal with these idiots any further "
Customer_688, DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE ," Not even worth one star to be honest but here's my take, Cardiff branch in city centre (07/04/2015), made me wait for 45 minutes then told me they would not process my query as they would take too long and to come back tomorrow.. also with attitude as English is not my first language and and they spoke to me like I was a piece of rubbish with disrespect. As I left  their colleagues were glaring and smirking at me, presumably talking about me which was very rude and unprofessional. "
Customer_689, Criminals ," Take money from your account and sends it to offshore accounts and then don't even replace the money they take.£400 went missing (literally in my account one day and out the next without even a single description of what happened to it) out of my account... nothing on the statement and apparently no bank error"".However! if a payment you arrange to come out on the 1st is reserved by the bank on the 23rd of the previous month but you don't get paid until the 27th they will charge you £8 for not having the money in your account. ALSO they refuse to give me an overdraft after being with them since I was 9 years old.... Never been in debt at all - there is just no reason for it.They even stole £68 which was supposed to be paid to Virgin"
Customer_69, overall not good looking some … , overall not good looking some alternatives. 
Customer_690, Discusting behaviour treated like a criminal , I went to the same cashpoint I always use in Stoke and the machine said script error and went onto a desktop screen so I went inside they said that they will sort it out so I waited then got told I can not have my card back because they don't know my intention on that card and that I could be using it in a dodgy way so I explained what happened on the account and they spoke to me like I was a piece of rubish and I explained I need the money for my child and was then told your not getting it back you have no Id I so I showed them the id and then they took the card and cut it up the team at this branch are complete and utter disrespectful and I would like them to be formally spoken to and given a suspension no one should ever feel like a criminal in a bank full of people sick people you have working there. 
Customer_691, Incompetence of the highest degree! ," I opened a current account with BANK_NAME some years ago, as a package deal with my mortgage. I didn't have a choice, it was a T&C of the deal. I didn't really use the account, so destroyed the card, for security reasons. In January 2015, I needed to start using the account, for the purpose it was set up ( To pay off my mortgage). So, I had an appointment with bank, to get a new card etc, on 15th January. They said that I couldn't do that,as the account was inactive. It was happily taking my money, but I was unable to draw out,as had no card. They promised to sort it out & order a card to be sent within 7 working days. After another visit to branch & several phone calls, I got fed up with waiting on 2/2/2015, so asked for it to be investigated. No response, so phoned again on 27/2/2015, to be told that account had been closed on 2/2/15, but it was still taking my money. Asked to make a formal complaint, but managers don't take phone calls. So, I was told everything had now been organised & I would need appointment at branch, to show I.D etc & card would then be issued. Went for appointment today, with a card that I received in the post this morning. Was told that card was no good, so they cancelled it & started to process for the card I needed. The assistant then stated, that she was from another branch & didn't have any information, so I was sent away, yet again, with another promise to sort it out!!!. So, I am back to square 1, with no card, money in my account, that I can't use & an account happily taking my money. It beggars belief, how a company can be so incompetent. Worse, if they don't sort it out soon, I will be in arrears with my mortgage & have to pay extra interest. I'm disgusted. "
Customer_692, Distressingly inadequate ," In branch, no problems except that they can't actually achieve anything beyond the simplest deposit or withdrawal. The customer service department in India is woefully inadequate. Apart from the language and cultural barriers, they do not appear to know how BANK_NAME works (if indeed it does)! The online banking service, frankly, is sh*te! I have never been able to conclude a single transaction without irritating issues, lockups, lockouts, etc. The layout of the website must have been designed by a five year old...poodle, and every time they 'improve' it, it gets worse. I'm off to RBS.At least they are openly dishonest! "
Customer_693, REALLY!!!! THIS BAD!!!! ," I joined BANK_NAME end of last year for my new business.  I figured it was a free account year one, and then lower fees than my previous business bank.Im sorry previous bank ... all is forgiven ... Im coming back!I spent half an hour on hold yesterday, trying to pay my suppliers. I gave up.  Called back.  Another fifteen minutes.  Told it was sorted.Today same issue, but all payments being delayed.  Spent half an hour holding because EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT was delayed (for security reasons!!!) ..gave up .. called back .. spoke to a Lady in Northampton ..like most of them very friendly and doing her best but stuck with a system that doesn't work,Finally have spent 50 minutes manually paying each of my suppliers...and still can't get a couple done because the system is now suspending my online banking membership .. THREE TIMES IN A ROW!Best advice she gave me, at the end Switch off and come back in an hour"
Customer_694," Very unprofessional helpdesk, waste of time !!! "," Called BANK_NAME telephone banking as my local branch was closed, just wanted to ask a simple question about a transaction I made the day before.The overseas helpdesk agent did not initially accept my security credentials so I asked why, the agent then proceeded to rant on for a couple of minutes about security without answering my question, the whole attitude was very unprofessional and a complete contrast to the branch assistants. After a further 7 minutes of getting nowhere I was finally told the team I needed to speak to only work Monday to Friday.So unprofessional, will never use again, what are BANK_NAME playing at ? we are paying for better standards than this, a complete waste of time.thanks for readingCJ "
Customer_695, BANK_NAME are utterly hopeless ," DO NOT BANK WITH BANK_NAME IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE. (We don't as our mortgage is with BANK_NAME.)They haven't one iota of a clue about customer service.Their processes are a shambles - we have not had a single administrative transaction complete without at least one and often several complaints being needed.Their poster in the local branch saying how they listen to customers is a travesty of the truth - these days if you make a complaint, they will no longer actually respond but will only note it for their consideration. and a bug in there computer system which confuses balance"" and ""cleared balance"" causes standing orders to fail if I pay a large cheque into my current account - still not fixed after I complained formally about it several times over 8 years ago.So"
Customer_696," Worst bank of ....India""!! """," Disgusting third world customer service!!Don t have a clue what they doing plus no apologies,they never call you back as they promise! "
Customer_697, horrible customer service ," other day i rang BANK_NAME  just to transfer money within my own accounts, indian support girl took 20 min and failed to do the job.its unacceptable service shame on you BANK_NAME, your online service is sh****t ontop no one to help in customer support close it and bring it back to UK "
Customer_698, Awful customer service , The worst bank on the highstreet. Do not bank with these guys. 
Customer_699, Online banking ... have to do it offline now! ," Used to be able to open and close accounts online and manage my OpenPlan savings settings in online banking. Last year I tried to close an account online - can't do that - you have to phone them. Called them - major problem at the call centre, please call again later or go to your branch. Went to the branch, only to find they can't close the account either - has to be done via the phone. So they had to call their own call centre! And they ended up having to wait an extra day as well!This year I wanted to update my OpenPlan savings settings only to find that option is not longer to be found in online banking. Sent them a message. Their response - sorry that option is no longer available in online banking you now have to pay for a phone call to their call centre to accomplish the same thing. Did they inform me of this change before they made it? Nope. Did they inform me after they made it? Nope. I only discovered it when I needed to use the service only to find it had gone! Unacceptable! What's the point in online banking if you can't do things when you are online! Oh yes, the point of online banking is to show you lots of adverts for banking services they can charge you for! Silly me... "
Customer_7,No Customer service and no staff training,I have been a BANK_NAME Customer for the past 24 years.  I have had various problems over the years with staff lack of training and no customer service skills. Now I am having trouble with the mobile banking app and was unable to make a crucial international payment whilst stranded abroad. I spent 3 hours on the phone at International call rates and finally asked to speak to someone in a UK located call centre.  I told her what I had been put through and wanted to make a complaint.  I had to fight for the complaint to be made and escalated as she said there was nothing that could be done except raise the cash withdrawal limit to the amount I had to pay and my complaint would not be upheld.  I told her it was not her decision to make and to write the complaint and I would also complain to the financial ombudsman. The complaint was written and I was given a reference number. Today I was called by someone who was allegedly a manager who patronised me and said it was not BANK_NAME fault I was stranded due to my car breaking.  I said no but it is your fault the mobile banking app had a fault and I could not get the money to the garage in time and spent 3 hours on the phone because no one knew what to do or offer a solution. I said the girl i spoke to last of all did not want tp raise my complaint and he called me a liar outright.  He said he was next to the girl on our conversation and she offered to raise a complaint.  She did no such thing.  He said he did not come to work to be spoken to like this and I would not speak to someone in the street or in my house this way.  At no point did I swear or call him names as he had called me a liar.  He escalated the complaint further as he did not have the skills or capacity to deal with the problem.  I have made a complaint to the Financial ombudsman. I hope that the phone calls are listened to so that it is clear that I am in no way a liar and I will no longer be banking with BANK_NAME after 24 years.  Absolutely disgusting.
Customer_70, Horrendous ," My experience with BANK_NAME has been horrendous, the customer service team are so rude and unhelpful and have a tendency of putting the phone down on you midway conversation as I have experienced this myself, they don't tell you but your limited to the amount of times you can make a complaint!!, even though as a customer you have rights!!, if they done there jobs properly then people wouldn't have to complain, don't rely on call backs if your ever told that's what you have to wait for, as you will be waiting a very long time as no one actually gets back to you when they say they will !!, they are very untrustworthy and I wouldn't recommend anyone to bank with BANK_NAME!! They tell you one thing and do something completely different. They have had the audacity to close my account without my knowledge, when I rung up to question about this, I got told that a letter had been sent to me which I still haven't recieved!! They all stick together there and don't care clearly about there customers!!It's clearly all about the money and nothing else!! Shameful "
Customer_700, Phone customer service ," Definately for the second time one of the worst customer service I have ever had.It's the second time that I call BANK_NAME Bank to understand my issue and the second time that they put me trough a recorded voice that takes me over 10 minutes to understand a small issue like an unrecognised debit on my balance. Without answer obviously. The line went down as long as my credit finished and they didn't even call me back.Very poor customer service, very long call for a small issue like asking the details of a direct debit, asking me twice my bank details even if I have inserted them before manually upon request of the recorded voice.I am so disappointed that on my BANK_NAME account App on my IPad,  which is very well programmed  and appears very nicely, my transactions never are on real time. Never. It's so easy to go overdraft without being notice of it.I apologise for the negative review but I hope this would be helpful to improve this service.Thank you "
Customer_701, Cannot go any further down the hill. ," When I transferred to BANK_NAME about 15 years ago the service could not have been better. Fast, efficient service in branch and a business manager I could walk in to see. He disappeared after a year, not to be replaced.The website is awful. Often foes not work. Error messages give a number to call where an automated system asks for date if birth, account number etc... How do I know this us genuine?Phone any BANK_NAME number you get the same. Wait to speak to a human and you could wait for ever. The telephone service is woeful.My local branch is a delight. If you want  to wait in a long line while the 2 clerks ( if you are lucky) work at the slowest pace imaginable. Every so often a person drifts around with an ipad but any query made to them results in the same answer--use our free telephone over there. And yes, you're back to the same telephone service described above.Occasionally a person achieves a result but that's as rare as hens teeth.Find a better bank? Do they exist or are they all as bad as one another? At the end if my tether with BANK_NAME. "
Customer_702, BANK_NAME Mortgage Application Nightmare ," Following separation from my Partner I approached my mortgage company BANK_NAME about either A) Buying her out or B) Seeing how much they would lend me. I had an agreement in principle and could choose either option. I decided that we would sell the house and move on.I duly put the house up for sale (unfortunatley with an agent/contract with 'Able Willing etc clause') and a few months later (after the initial DIP had expired) we agreed a sale and I found a property I wished to buy. Again for a second time I went through the decision in principle process and again was accepted.Completed/Signed all the forms and returned them to BANK_NAME.BANK_NAME then passed application through to the underwriters and the application was declined. The application was declined citing a problem with missed payments on a credit card some 3 years earlier (during a dispute with MBNA, note no defaults took place). Financially I am easilly able to pass the affordability tests and it is purely the dispute with MBNA which has caused this decline at full application timeI have been with BANK_NAME for the present mortgage for 17 years (never missed a single payement etc), and other than the MBNA episode have an exemplary credit history. I haven cleared quite a lot of outstanding debt (car loans etc) prior to the second decision in principle being granted, so am in an even better position than I was at the first applicationI'm now potentially left with a bill for £3500 pound for failed sale of my property (not to mention a battle with ex partner) and solicitors costs if I pull the plug on my house sale (not to mention the purchasers loosing their survey money etc) or having to move out/effectively be homeless with a 15 year old son, and potentially into rented accommodation if other mortgage lenders follow the same track as BANK_NAME did.To say that I currently despise BANK_NAME for this decision would be an understatement. They were fully aware about my credit history (as I disclosed this dispute with MBNA to them at both DIP applications) and their actions in all of this is nothing short of negligent.I will be fighting this all the way to the Ombudsman and beyond. Mortgage lenders should not be able to change their mind from a DIP to full application due to these reasons. They have not shown due diligence at the various stages of the application.I hope this post acts as a warning to others thinking of applying to BANK_NAME for a mortgage. There are other lenders who also fail to show due diligence at the DIP stage. I would never have put my property up for sale had I know at the initial DIP that I would be declined. "
Customer_703, I did not choose to have a mortgage with BANK_NAME.... ," We originally took out a mortgage with ING Direct. They were subsequently taken over by BANK_NAME/Woolwich. Since this transition our experience dealing with them via the call centre has been a joke. We do not have an account with the or credit card but they always insist on asking us for our sort code. We have, apparently, a mortgage membership number. We have been trying for some time now to set up our online banking so we can view our mortgage statement. To date and having spent hours to a call centre in India this has proved fruitless. This company is a joke. If you want a mortgage DO NOT BANK WITH THEM. Again... this wasn't our choice to do business with them. If I had known ING would sell up I would have gone elsewhere. AVOID. "
Customer_704, Shoddy let downs ," I have been with BANK_NAME for around 5 years now it have never been able to get the most out of my account due to the inability to meet with an advisor in branch because of major anxiety issues.I spoke to a lady called Shauna today and she was so helpful and polite,I told her what difficulties I was having and she arranged someone to meet me tomorrow to help get the most out of my account and improve my credit score.Really delighted with the service today!GrantScrap that.They never turned up for the arranged appointment,never called or anything.I rang up to ask what happened and the advisor told me my branch doesn't do home visits!!I asked why did they book me in and she said to call you to arrange appointment....ok so why didn't they call me either?She said she will arrange for them to call me the next day and again I heard nothing.Absolutely shocking shoddy service !! "
Customer_705, No troubles so far ," I've been with BANK_NAME for 13 years now, and have never had a problem. Last year I had an issue with paypal where my account was hacked and a substantial amount of money was frauded from my bank account. I went to my local branch and left confident that the issue was going to be resolved. The gent sat me down and answered all the questions that were on my mind, and even helped me make a phone call to paypal to make sure they were going to do their job on their end. "
Customer_706, Appalling Customer Service ," I have consistently had the worst customer service from BANK_NAME.Phone banking teams, usually from India, don't know what they are doing, one advised me that a drawdown from a mortgage offset would cost me 60% in interest a year!  When I queued and went in a branch, I was informed that would actually be the current mortgage rate which is 1.25% a year.Frankly how a supposedly reputable bank can hire people who don't understand English, and are happy to give out totally incorrect information is beyond me.  It really is Mickey Mouse banking. But I have also had very poor customer service in branch on occasions.Currently I've been waiting for phone banking for the last 30 minutes.They put all their money into the online banking area, which is good, but the quality of their service elsewhere is terrible.I've moved my current account and credit card to Santander, who actually seem to give a damn. "
Customer_707, Just terrible ," On hold for hours waiting to get through to a call centre in India, that provided no resolution whatsoever. The best they could do was give a contact number of a relationship manager back in the UK. They could not go off script, be proactive or show initiative. They were completely unaware of any of our business details. "
Customer_708, Disappointing Experience ," I have been a loyal customer to BANK_NAME for nearly 9 years and had to say that this is the last straw for me after a couple of bad experiences.First of all I went into branch to request a same day replacement card as my local branch does that kind of service. Twice of which I didn't get my card replacement same day because one the equipment broke down and two they unintentionally refuse to give me it after I showed them ID instead they ordered a replacement by post to my house which I didn't want.Secondly I wanted to upgrade to a current account of my choice and filled in an online application. Which then said I have to phone up customer services to arrange an appointment at my local branch so I'd give them the day I want to be in and said they'll phone me back by that day, which didn't happen so I phoned them back again and again and their response is something like they didn't know about it.It took a while to wait for a operator to reach to me both on the phone and love chat. anyway I am switching banks now and I think my time with BANK_NAME is done for now. "
Customer_709, Abysmally inept ," Over the past 9 years, BANK_NAME UK has managed to shock me with its failure to look after me as a customer. Where shall  begin? Let's start with the time i went to Australia for work and despite reassurances from my local branch that my debit card would work, as it should in the current time and age of the world, it didn't in fact work, at all, ever. I called the help desk and was led around a wild goose chase for someone, anyone, who could at least provide me with the means to sustain myself financially for the remainder of my sojourn. A debit card was indeed sent out to replace the one that had been blocked, but it was sent to my UK address and it was there that i found it, a year later. Shall we talk about the Online Banking facility? I am left speechless by how unacceptably bad this 'service' is, in a time when online banking is a feature offered by all banks across most of their accounts. I have not been able to log in once since October 2014. The time i manage to speak to someone at the 'help' desk, i am asked to go to the branch with ID to prove i am who i am. I make it to the branch only to be told there is nothing wrong with my online banking and that a new debit card has been sent out for me. Why? Who knows. A week later, new card in hand, i try to log in again only to once more face the same error message and a screen that tells me i have been locked out due to security reasons. I am closing my account as soon as i can afford to pay back the loan amount i took out last year. There is absolutely nothing this bank can do for me. "
Customer_71, Dear BANK_NAME, 
Customer_710, UNTRUSTWORTHY ," Paid a bill through BANK_NAME Stamford on 6 Jan 2015, 9 days before it was due.  22 days later the payment had not been received by the company I was paying.  When asked why it had not been paid, the branch operative said it was probably a clerical error.  I asked if she could check on the computer if there was a problem, but was told they would investigate at first opportunity, and they would resubmit my payment, using the red slip the payee had sent.  Apart from the embarrassment this has caused, it has also cost me in telephone bills and petrol, and I still have no answers as to why it wasn't paid within the three working days that they say it should take to pay.  I am surprised they still have account holders, if this is the way they treat people. "
Customer_711, business account opening ," Tried to open a business account at BANK_NAME. The issue was in a transliterated version of my name (note, I'm from EU). The manager refused to open an account, though I provided all proofs of my original name spelling: ID, Passport, Law and Utility Bill. I've been trying to convince him for 3 weeks, no chance. Opened an account easily in another bank. BANK_NAME - never again. "
Customer_712, USELESS , Spent over 30 mins on hold with a repeated Sorry for the wait
Customer_713, Unhelpful and awful ," I work away often, as they ask you to. Tell them when and where your going so you can use your card. I follow that every time. I go away and instantly first purchase cards blocked. Ring them supposed to be free, I have never actually gotten a free call to them from overseas. Always charged. Out of 8times this has happened once it was sorted over the phone.Every other time I was told go to a cash machine and enter pin. In the UK. I'm in Canada for 2 weeks that's not possible.I was told sorry we can't help. i was in Cyprus working and for several months they couldn't send me a card out as Cyprus wasn't covered, so I had to get it sent home then to Cyprus.I've had bills and charges that's built up over £200 and they say they can help me, even though I told them I was using card over seas. Not once did they contact me as there supposed to and ask if it's me spending my money overseas.When I've had problem in the UK and rang them, they never do help. if I had time I would change banks after using BANK_NAME for over 15years. "
Customer_714, Customer service , Just been on the phone and hold for over 30min for an adviser to tell me that their specific team that needs to speak to me do no operate on weekends. Spoke the line manager who don't understand anything I say and very unhelpful. I have been a long standing customer of BANK_NAME but the customer service has gone good to really bad hence I have decided to close my account with them 
Customer_715, Customer service ," good phone service, polite an very helpful "
Customer_716, Service Desk was rubbish! ," Called them 2 times and they could not help. Ordered a new PIN for online banking and it did not arrive after 10 days.Went to the bank activated PIN senty, then i was able to log on online banking set up a new PIN code and now i can log on on both ways.The help desk never suggested something like this and they are HELP !!! "
Customer_717, New branch in Leamington Spa ," Outrageously bad!! The only people that can access this branch now are people with a degree in I.T, and when you just can't cope with the equipment any longer they provide a rude member of staff to really kick the boot in by telling you off for not using it corectly and doing their very best to make you feel totally stupid!! Well done BANK_NAME!! if you want the really bad customer service award, you just won it!! "
Customer_718, disappointed i had to give a star!! ," Money has been taken from my account without my authorisation, i pay account fees to protect me against theft  and yet they can't (won't) do anything for 15 days, however in 15 days time they will investigate and see if they can retrieve the stolen money!!!I can safely say it has made my mind up with whether to close my accounts with them, what with the increase of computers and decrease in real people in their branches and the lack of protection they are giving me ......... I WILL BE CLOSING ALL MY ACCOUNTS I HOLD WITH THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. "
Customer_719, Time wasters ," Blocked my card as I tried to make a payment to someone. Spent ages on the phone on hold finally got through to the call center answered all the security questions was told that my account had been blocked and i had to speak to the fraud department, was put on hold again only to be told that the fraud department had clossed? It was only Saturday afternoon! So now I've had to waste another 25 minutes trying to sort it out again. Im not filled with confidence that this will not happen again! :( "
Customer_72, Goes to the dogs and cats , Goes to the dogs and cats. Products are getting very bad. 
Customer_720, BANK_NAME business banking , I have a small but growing and profitable business despite banking with these jokers.   Latest in a catalogue of poor service is that my debit card and all direct debits have been out on hold while the bank tries to contact me about some activity on my account.   My account is run immaculately but clearly something has them in a huff so after apparently trying to contact me since November they have unilaterally blocked my business account and therefore my business.  The genius of BANK_NAME business is that your account manager keeps his telephone number a secret so you can only deal with the drones at the call centre.   I have evidently received a handful of missed calls from an unknown number which is then saying that they have tried and failed to contact me.     What happened to voice mail or email or a letter requesting that I contact them urgently about my account.  That would mean giving a phone number which would break their secret squirrel policy of not wanting to be contacted direct.  In other words I have an account manager but it's a secret who he his or how to contact him.  Still waiting for them to call me - I am now in Thailand 7 hours ahead and my phone is likely to keep going to vociemail - which apparently is a crime in BANK_NAME lah lah land. I get the distinct impression that I exist to make my bankers life easier. Any one thinking of setting up a business and being lulled into a relationship with these people - don't. 
Customer_721, BANK_NAME online banking availability is unreliable. ," On the last 2 occasions I have attempted to check my current account online the service has been unavailable. No explanation other than the catch all generic sometimes due to updates and service"" is offered. Well BANK_NAME must be doing a lot of servicing!Once was frustrating but stuff happens"
Customer_722, Room for improvement ," I've been with most banks, BANK_NAME are by far the best my only problem is the site reliability. Maintainance is fair enough but it's quite regular and always when your money goes in or out around midnight. Please BANK_NAME, start work at 2am-6am so people can make sure money is in or out before you start work. "
Customer_723, Glorified SCAMMER! ," CLosed my account w/o warning! and was toold that I dont have money left in my account and they wont give out statements-- MONKEYS!  I Have almost 15k in my bank account, now filing complaint through ombudsman.if you value your money avoid this scammers "
Customer_724, Online Banking is Rubbish ," BANK_NAME online banking has changed - again!  For the better - definitely not.  You can't get to where you want to be.  You have to scroll down miles to see the information you require. Downloading statements is a complete joke with two pages of helpful information"" at the end of every statement.  And page numbers of statements are at the bottom of each page - how convenient.  Get a grip BANK_NAME.  Online banking is supposed to make things easier not complicate things.  Whoever came up with these ""improvements"" must have done it with their eyes closed. """
Customer_725, Financial Disservices ," Frustrating and useless. I tried to switch to BANK_NAME since it offered some products that my main bank did not. After trying to use BANK_NAME for a few months, I have now discovered that if I have the audacity to require paper statements then BANK_NAME compensates for this inconvenience by making it impossible for me to also view such statements and transactions online. Trying to obtain transactional information between infrequent paper statements then requires multi-hour sessions lost within BANK_NAME' maze of call centres. I am not sure how to describe politely such customer service policies. I can suggest that potential customers seeking proper service look elsewhere. "
Customer_726, would give less if possible , Have been going around in circles following online banking entry instructions and getting nowhere. Tried the online chat and was told I was in a 7 min queue. waited 7 mins and then the message came through that the operator had cut me off.  Total waste of time. 
Customer_727, Abysmally ignorant staff and farcical 24/7 telephone customer service ," Requested today at my branch a renewal of my VISA Debit card because it expiring while travelleling abroard three months from now. Did ask specifically whether I could continue using current card, which the branch clerc confirmed. Was faced several hours later with the fact that my allegedly still valid card had been blocked. Would be only half as bad if I didn't have to board a plane tomorrow, with no cash, no possibility to pick up a booked rental car on arrival, or pay for hotel etc. Have been trying to reach so-called 24/7 customer service without sucess for the past 2 hours, having gone through three rounds of 1/2 hr wait on the phone, before slamming the receiver down in unabated anger. "
Customer_728, Does BANK_NAME online banking EVER work? ," I've been a BANK_NAME customer for years and have been using their telephone banking service.  All has been ok until one time I found out that despite calling and making a payment to my credit card the payment wasn't completed.  I decided to give online banking a try.  Since joining about 3 months ago, it has only worked once.  I am so shocked at the pathetic system which I would say if I have tried logging on 100 times, it has only worked on 2 occasions.  BANK_NAME you should hang your heads in shame.  By comparison, I have a Santander account which works brilliantly. "
Customer_729, Terrible Service , ING was the best banking service I've ever had.  BANK_NAME is the worst.  As a result of their grotesque incompetence a fund that I set up to support my profoundly disabled child has lost its income.  But that's ok because they're paying themselves huge bonuses and fixing the currency exchange.So many more things to say but I'm exhausted by it all. 
Customer_73, Awful bank ," Awful bank! They still hold my money without legal consent. I ordered to transfer my  money to an accout i hold with another bank because I do not have a current account with BANK_NAME and they are reluctant to do the process; all excuses and apologies. Hence, I cannot use my money at all. I am in a hopeless situation where it seems that so much hard work and effort has been wasted because the bank is archaic and dishonest. These people are thieves and the courts have been informed. Soon they will also have to pay compensation. Upon the successful prosecution, I will do everything possible to destroy their reputation, since the media will be informed for their actions. This bank is the absolute evil. Thieves, corrupt, lazy, incompetent, reptiles, dishonest... plus, I will have to add the unhelpful customer service, the ridiculous system with their security checks that treats the customer like potential thieves, while the only thieves are themselves for holding without my consent 12000£.If you want to risk you money try BANK_NAME. If you don't want to see your life and savings ruined, then do not trust them! If you are already with them switch to another bank. Make these thieves pay the price! "
Customer_730, Rude. ," There have been a few times when my card has been randomly blocked and I've had no explanation for it.Last time I went into the branch to see if I could extend my overdraft, the people in the branch were very lovely and very helpful. However, when I needed to talk to someone on the phone both the people I spoke to were very rude and patronising. In the end I wasn't allowed the money I asked for because one of them actually attached a note to my account saying that I tried to get money for Christmas presents. I didn't, in fact Christmas was just one of the things I mentioned among food for 2 months, books for my course and travelling home. I didn't not appreciate the way I was spoken to at all. "
Customer_731," Unhelpful, slow and poor ", I got moved from ING Direct (who were great!) - I am now stuck with terrible service - lost of time wasted - very poor advice and phone disconnected by them many times. 
Customer_732, Terrible.  Cancelled card for no reason then asked me to say thanks when they unblocked it! ," Long story short: Friday night,  find card is not working.  Spend 2 hours on the phone between 4 different advisors to find that the new card they sent me at the beginning of the month was only valid for 28 days... For anybody who has read the other reviews here it will be no surprise to know that a)  the card had an expiry date of 2017 b) no correspondence had been received informing me of any 28 day expiry,  and c) why would a new card only be valid for 28 days?!?!  Clearly the reason was complete bs.Their call centre drones are so indoctrinated and robotic that they can't possibly admit that it was completely and utterly BANK_NAME fault. To make things even worse,  after wasting 2 hours of my time to unblock the card,  the advisor suggested I thank her for rectifying the issue!! Really!!   I'd love to think this was lost in translation but honestly...  She was rude. So disgustingly rude.  No access to money for (at the least) the weekend and they just treated it as...  My fault. Unbelievably terrible experience.  Dissapointed is an understatement.Customer of 20 years,  now leaving.  Good riddance,  your company does not deserve our money; it deserves to fail. "
Customer_733, unethical team & Disorganised ," BANK_NAME bank in Dubai has proved to have unethical, inefficient, chaotic and unprofessional legal and compliance teams. The two teams are extremely unethical in their dealings with clients and have consistently tried to cover for their internal shortcomings, inefficiency and chaotic internal relationships by blaming their clients. They are untruthfull and not trustworthy teams who should be the example for ethics and high standards.The legal team and the compliance teams have major issues internally and from personal experience have tried to cover up for these issues by ruining their clients livelihoods and businesses. I would never recommend this bank nor would I trust to employ any person from these two teams in any bank. They are disgrace to BANK_NAME and to Dubai. "
Customer_734, unprofessional staff members at the Branch! ," I went to this branch in London for an address change (as they don't allow the change online like most of the other banks do), and the lady who was serving me was so full of bad attitude did not even say hi or smiled and made me feel very unwelcomed by her very very unpleasant behaviour and was rushing to send me asap. I mean you expect a certain level of customer service etiquettes from big banks and companies but it is such a shame they hire rude and unprofessional staffs to add on their notorious list of being a failing bank and the worst bank ever to deal with! There needs to be a serious rectification in the management of bank staffs' manners and ethics so they can properly represent one of the financial institutions in UK. "
Customer_735, common sense and customer service not included ," Firstly they allowed cheques, not written by me, to be presented by a person no longer associated with the account and then charged me for 3 bounced cheques. Then they tell me I have missed mortgage payments when in fact they had failed to activate the direct debit that had been set up.  I phoned them about this and they assured me that the DD was set up, stated the amount of same and that it was active.  Found out 2 months later that it still wasnt being drawn so went in to bank to sort it, finally payments were being made but, BANK_NAME have taken no responsibility or apologised for the mistake resulting in my credit rating going down and Ihave now been refused a small loan to assist my house move. I dont owe any money but their actions have had a massive knock on effect. This final error this morning goes to demonstrate further their inability to do even the simplest tasks with any accuracy.  I should have changed banks 20 years ago when they paid a cheque for 5k into  joint account instead of the account of a similarly named account holder. When i brought it to  BANK_NAME attention, they corrected the error and even showed me the account details of the person who should have received the money. Needless to say when a few months later the same thing happened, I phoned the other account holder and informed them of the repeated error. I'm not sure what they were more mad about, the repeated mistake or that I knew all their personal details, and how. An apology and recognition of their mistake was never received.I recently put in a complaint to BANK_NAME Bank for repeated mistakes and poor service on my accounts. Today I get a text message with a reference number to 'track' my complaint. I go to the website specified and put in the reference number, the screen puts up an error message thats says there are insufficient digits. I check that I have entered it correctly,yes, exactly as in the text. The web page gives me a phone number to call if I should 'experience difficulties' so I call it. Call handler answers, doesn't even give a good morning or any other salutation, just says we are unable to help with your enquiry as all our computer systems are down for an upgrade"". Silence. I try to ask a question which is answered with ""try again in half an hour"". Silence. I hang up and wonder why the upgrades to computer systems are not done over night as they are in most other large business's. I am expecting another text with a reference number for a new complaint.  I have received a further text from BANK_NAME saying that they have received a request from my solicitor for the redemption cost of my mortgage. This is the third I have received since 3rd October. My solicitor is still waiting for the figures and when I log in to BANK_NAME 'track it' web page"
Customer_736, PATHETIC BANK , The worst bank ever...!!!!!!!!!!!!! They keep charging for God knows what and then ignore complaints !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Customer_737, this is how not-to-bank!!! ," That is the most horrible bank I have ever been with! Don't u even think about opening account there!

Customer_741, horrible service ," have asked for bank statement for specified days couple of times and then received the copy of monthly statement both times. Applied for mandate change more than a months ago and still haven't heard from them , the worse service ever. "
Customer_742, Appalling customer service ," After over 30 years of banking with BANK_NAME I am in the process of closing all my accounts. BANK_NAME managed to lose £1000 of my money while transferring it between two BANK_NAME accounts. Despite numerous phone calls to their so called 'customer service' nobody would take any ownership of the problem. I had to speak to a different person every time, they seemed to think it was reasonable that the problem might not be resolved for 8 weeks (despite it being lost by them, between two of their own accounts) and nobody would provide any contact details. It was simply impossible to speak to the same person twice. When they did call me they left a message saying, 'please call BANK_NAME Bank'. No name, no number. Whoever left the message (I never did find out because my account notes were not kept up to date) had obviously never had the distressing experience of trying to contact BANK_NAME. I discovered today that the money was returned yesterday.  That's 3 weeks after it went missing. I have, of course, received no message from BANK_NAME to let me know the problem had been resolved. Despite my loyalty after all these years I have finally taken the plunge and am moving all my accounts because of the unbelievably awful customer service.  There was one exception to this. I went into the branch and spoke to one of the personal bankers. He was great, said all the right things and was equally horrified by the service I had received by the bank he works for. Sadly he wasn't empowered to actually return my money but the day after I spoke to him it was returned to me - so perhaps he did have some influence somewhere. I like to think so. "
Customer_743, horrible , I have had a current account with BANK_NAME since I was 15 I recently opened a student account and they didn't update my ID. This has meant that I can't get the student overdraft because my account is still 11-15. The person who was opening my account was meant to update my ID and change my current account so it's no longer 11-15. She didn't. That is not what annoyed me the most. I went to two different branches and got given two completely different things that I had to do. The inconstancy is what got me. After leaving the second branch I called to make a complaint and was put through to some person who clearly didn't understand what I was on about. I spoke to them for over an hour and I'm still no closer to knowing what's going to happen to my account and when. They said every complaint is dealt with within 8 weeks and then I can go to the FCA I hope the mess up so I can I need something done about things. This could easily be solved by using a passport but I don't have one. They have barely any alternatives because apparently everyone must have a drivers license or passport. They have my ID on their system but apparently its not good enough to update it.  I'm so confused and they really need to be dealt with. 
Customer_744, What Premier customer services what a joke! ," I've been calling the premier banking team and am currently on hold for nearly an hour the second time tonight, disgraceful, and to think they charge £10 per month for the privelage -,what a joke "
Customer_745, Awful customer services & Systems:  ING Transfer has resulted in missing statements ," I moved from ING Direct to BANK_NAME Direct in Aug 2014.  I have had numerous problems logging into my account and having a whole raft of confusing paper work, pins, cards and card readers sent to me.  I've spent hours on the phone just trying to login.  To clarify I work in IT and understand systems migrations of significant size since I've undertaken 3 of them in my career.Every call has been handled incredibly badly by the BANK_NAME off shore services team.  They never quite understand the problem and repeatedly ask What is the purpose of you trying to login online banking"" as if the fact it doesn't work is irrelevantand you need to justify why you want to check your statement.  I shouldn't need to confirm why I want to log in to be able to get assistance!!My ING mortgage account isn't showing up on my account and have spent two hours now on the phone"
Customer_746, Very responsive customer service , Any.problems I have had with BANK_NAME and BANK_NAMEcard have always immediately put right with cash payments and apologies. Very helpful customer services. 
Customer_747, Was ING now BANK_NAME Online banking bad move out of my hands ," Since the takeover of ING by BANK_NAME, i have not been able to view my online mortgage.... never ending phone calls later and pounds in costs and a complaint in branch... still no help from them... says problem is IT and complicated will take time to fix... been 2 months now still not able to see my mortgage at all...... BANK_NAME just fobbing me off all the time "
Customer_748, Mindless idiots ," First they put image of a rat on their website, then when I explained that I have phobia for them and asked them to let me know when it is removed, so I can use they website again, they replied that they are not aware of any site problems"
Customer_749, Nightmare customer service , I used my card abroad but it said I had insufficient balance. Eventually getting through to customer service (outsourced to india) they kept telling me to use a different bank and different machine. I gave up and had to get western union transfers to get money and then 2 weeks later I found that I had £1800 taken from my account where I had been trying but didn't receive the money.BANK_NAME have dealt with this complaint appalling. At first they forgot to log the complaints and I have asked for cctv which would prove I didn't get the money but they refuse to ask for these. It is now 18 weeks since I complained and they still have only given me part of the results of the investigation. They never ring me back and it takes at least 25 minutes to get through to them when I call.I have been with them for 25 years but have lost complete trust and will transfer all my money to a new bank this week ready for my next trip abroad.If BANK_NAME are reading this and want to contact me then here is one of the references so you can find me - 8586-23jun14. 
Customer_75, Some years ago I fell on hard times it … ," Some years ago I fell on hard times it can happen to us all at any time to be fair we are only one paycheck away from being homeless and I was very close to that a few years ago, yes I made some mistakes I made a few bad business decisions and lost everything, I couldn't even get a bank account, the only so-called credit cards that were being offered to me during this period were credit cards from companies where you paid fees of between 20 and £25 a month, there was no real proper facilities for banking with them and these companies were making a fortune on every transaction you made.Until a friend suggested that I approached BANK_NAME's bank, given my circumstances I was reluctant, as every other banker turned me down, but to my surprise BANK_NAME's were the only bank prepared to give me a second chance I opened a basic account and had my income paid directly into the account, I met face-to-face with a bank representative who could not have been more helpful courteous at all times even when I explained my difficulties and circumstances they still were prepared to give me a bank account and for that I will always be grateful,Thanks to BANK_NAME's now I'm in a better place I have a great relationship with BANK_NAME's bank and I have to say the customer occur service is excellent, if at any time BANK_NAME's bank feel that a transaction that I am doing does not feel right or if there is activity on my account which they are not happy with they are on the phone to me straightaway, I had reason to make it purchase which Currys PC World over the last few days, the amount was in excess of £900, when the salesperson tried to put the amount through BANK_NAME's bank were on it straightaway, no you may think that I would have been annoyed or upset with the fact that the payment didn't go through quite the contrary, I was delighted that BANK_NAME's bank were watching my account and ensuring that my interests were being looked after, after the transaction failed to go through I contacted the bank explain my situation and BANK_NAME's bank could not have been more helpful, because the amount was a large amount of red flag flew up on the transaction and BANK_NAME's were honoured like a shot, there wasn't a problem at all BANK_NAME simply needed to be reassured that I was not been ripped off by some fraudster and immediately allow the payment to go through once assured it was a genuine transaction,.So I want to say to BANK_NAME's bank a big thank you to each and everyone of you for all the help and support that you have given me over the last 2 1/2 years, I have dealt with other banks in the past and have never had the kind of excellent service that I've had from BANK_NAME's bank so thank you again "
Customer_750," worst bank ever, shocking "," After 3 months of trying to arrange a business meeting as they don't work past 3 and not wknds , I recieved a call on the day saying business manager was ill. Another 2 months later still not heard anything back. Moved all business and personal accounts to metrobank was done in 30 mins and walked out with my new cards. Gave up after nearly 3 hours on the phone to BANK_NAME customer services just getting past from pillar to post with no clarity or solution to anything.  They didn't even have notes about my accounts,  just simply don't care. Life's to short,  move to metrobank who work on your terms and actually value you. "
Customer_751, Abysmal customer service since migration from ING Direct ," I'm an ex-ING Direct customer and was used to very good customer service, but this has all changed for the worse since my accounts were supposedly migrated to BANK_NAME at the end of July. I can view my savings account on-line, but have not been able to access my mortgage account since July. I've spent ages on the phone to BANK_NAME, being passed from pillar to post and no-one I've spoken to seemed to have a clue about what's going on with the ING migration. I'm just contacting them via their on-line system now as I can't afford to waste time on the phone, but they don't bother replying anymore, so I've raised a formal complaint.The official BANK_NAME line seems to be that all ex-ING accounts, both savings and mortgage, have been successfully migrated, but that is clearly not true in my case, and I am aware of other ex-ING mortgage customers who have had similar issues. I've been involved with a number of system migrations in the past 30 years and the process should be straightforward if the analysis is done properly before the migration starts and thorough testing is done during and after the migration. In the case of the ING migration, someone has clearly screwed up and heads should be rolling down the corridors of BANK_NAME Towers"" as there appears to have been a systemic failure in several phases of the project lifecycle"
Customer_752, The worst business banking experience ever ," When we opened up our business account it all seemed very promising, then problems began, starting with the company secretary getting married and needing to change the surname details on the account, which we tried to do several times, but the name still hadn't been changed when we closed the account to go elsewhere. Trying to get finance for new projects was a joke, we had a great credit rating and good profit margins, but could we get a loan? Yeah from everywhere except BANK_NAME, our business contact at the bank looked like he'd only just got out of nappies and often acted as such, my advice would be to avoid this bank at all costs. "
Customer_753, terrible all round for business banking ," having used BANK_NAME as a business bank it took us 3 months to open the first account, we were insulted by staff at the Crouch End office, the online banking tool does not work 75% of the time, Pinsentry is the worst system - the machine works with 4 (1) flat batteries and when they run out you have to do 5 working days without banking while they order a replacement, making a payment by telephone banking takes half a day, staff all across the company are rude and unhelpful. despite being a global bank, BANK_NAME has the worst currency account service. Avoid this bank at all costs "
Customer_754," Nope, you've lost me! "," Despite being a Premier Life customer, a continual stream of screw ups took me away and over to the joys of First Direct... Vote with your feet! "
Customer_755, 50 years as a BANK_NAME customer and service has deteriorated to rock-bottom ," I had not realised how poor BANK_NAME service has become until I tried to transfer an amount via online banking using pin-sentry with authentication card. For some reason the pin locked and I was instructed to contact the bank, which I did via telephone. Virgin landline call charges are not the cheapest and I waited for about 15 mins to receive an answer from an Indian call-centre. The lady informed me that I could clear the locked pin via any ATM. I promptly drove to an ATM machine and attempted to clear the pin to no avail. I drove home and telephoned the same number as before and again after about 15 mins the call was answered by an Indian male operator who informed me that only a BANK_NAME ATM would work. Had I known this, I could have driven further in the first instance, to a Barcley's ATM. I was livid and lodged a complaint via the operator who stated that this would be a level 1 complaint. I asked to raise the level  to 2 so that I could speak to an operator in the UK and was asked to hold for a short while. After another approx 15 mins the Indian operator returned to apologise for the delay at which I launched a tirade of abuse concerning BANK_NAME's service and hung up. I don't know how many complaint levels BANK_NAME's customer-service utilise but I would suggest a very large number, so that they can spread the obvious huge total very thinly.So called online banking is a joke when a problem cannot be solved online. I cleared all the sensitive required information online and via telephone and yet I still now have to journey to a BANK_NAME's branch to stick a card into a machine (assuming this will actually give me the option of unlocking the pin). Once reactivated I will enjoy transferring any residual balances into one of my other accounts with  either Virgin or Halifax. It seems that after 50 years BANK_NAME are really no further on than the old passbook and cheque- book days for convenience, with the added burden of appalling customer dissatisfaction. mike(Stockport area) "
Customer_756, Telephone Banking! DREADFUL ," My Ing account was transferred to Barclyas and I have been trying to speak to them about the authorisation card they should have sent me... Trying to speak to them on the phone is a trail and a half - ages and ages on hold and they only advertise the premium rate number.Complete incompetence when you finally do talk to someone and they keep needing to transfer you to a specialised department - which means 10 minutes + on hold again! Even the Complaints Department is experiencing an unusual number of calls"" and takes more than 10 minutes - I hung up and started typing!!! They also used exactly the same lie to explain the delay on two separate calls - ""my colleague was experiencing trouble with his computer"" - even if it had been true"
Customer_757, 4 months and already leaving ," From our switch over to BANK_NAME at the end of April 2014 until present (Aug 2014), the service provided has been utterly useless.  We've lost count of the amount of times they've created problems (e.g. taking my husband's name off the joint account for no apparent reason); not been able to follow through with simple banking tasks; and overall, been totally unhelpful with our requests.  We are now changing banks after only 4 months with BANK_NAME.  It has taken unnecessary time, energy and a lot of stress on behalf of myself and my husband using BANK_NAME for such a short period of time.  I would discourage anyone from using this bank. "
Customer_758, Truly dreadful customer service ," I've been trying to get through to the BANK_NAME call centre to obtain a new passcode - it is virtually impossible to speak to a real person.  I actually did manage to get through once and then was cut off (deliberately in my opinion, because they couldn't be arsed to sort out my query).I will now have to go to an actual branch but no doubt they will be just as unhelpful - and in these modern times, I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT!I didn't even ask to have an account with BANK_NAME - my ING account got transferred to BANK_NAME.  I'm going to close it down and go elsewhere! "
Customer_759, Utterly awful. Premier Banking is even worse than normal ! ," BANK_NAME are dreadful.

Customer_760, Terrible ," I have been a long term BANK_NAME customer. Just tried to sort out a fraud issue (there wasn't one) but they were worried there was.. Got through to an Indian call centre, they took my card number down wrongly on 2 occasions. Could not find any transactions for the authorisation checks even though I was reading them from online banking, live in front of me. Really poor service. Im sure I wouldn't do particularly well in an Indian call centre fielding calls from Indian citizens. Point is that the whole experience was very frustrating. Not the first time either.Tried another number and been on hold for 30 mins, just put the phone down.I have considered changing banks and now I will... "
Customer_761, Shocking customer service ," We took our mortgage on our first property with BANK_NAME (Woolwich) as they offered us the highest lending amount. We have regretted it ever since.A string of errors and incompetence left our house purchase at risk of falling through. During this time they even managed to get the address of the property we were buying wrong! We only found out after daily phone calls for weeks to chase progress. Finally we were told the valuation was booked so called the surveyors-to be told the address they had was different to the property we were buying. This combined with zero communication from BANK_NAME (we had to chase them almost daily to find out they needed further documents etc) left us lodging a formal complaint.Our complaint again required us to chase them. Eventually we got a letter in early June saying they would give us compensation for their poor service. We have yet to receive this compensation (2 months later) and are now on hold for over 50 minutes to chase this. They also held incorrect details on the mortgage account that was setup-wrong date of birth, contact numbers and postal addresses. Ordered debit card in branch-chase 2 weeks later and there's no record of them being ordered.Absolutely diabolical processes and systems. The average time per phone call has been 45mins (30mins of which is spent on hold).We will never use BANK_NAME again and will make sure friends and family do the same.They are in the customer service business and yet they do not seem to have any comprehension of what that means. I only wish we had seen the reviews on this site before proceeding. "
Customer_762, Worst bank ever ," BANK_NAME have been bad over the years, but they have got so much worse lately. They have no idea what they are walking about, are arrogant and lie. They have had a lot of 'down time' recently, and when I queried why their online banking was down recently they told me it wasn't. Long story short - it was. I was on the phone for over 40 minutes trying to explain that it wasn't working, when finally I was told that despite the fact that all forums and the BANK_NAME downtime calculator were showing the system down, it was my computer that had a problem. I have three computers, I have four browsers, all were affected, it wasn't me, it was them. They refused to take responsibility and told me to update my computers. Totally rubbish. I spoke to four different departments and ended up with the complaints department who assured me it was my fault. These guys need to be investigated - and I hope something nasty is found that sees them barred from operating. "
Customer_763, Trustworthy and solid customer care , I have only had one grievance with my bank in 30 years regarding mis-selling. The matter was dealt with promptly and compensation exceeded expectations. 
Customer_764," Run away now, before it's too late; YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! "," The deplorable manner of this company is truly shocking! We have recently had to raise a formal complaint following the completely unsympathetic and callous attitude of their staff.We have been trying to apply for a mortgage recently as a first time buyer, we approached BANK_NAME for a mortgage as we had entrusted them with inherited savings following a bereavement. We have hoped to use the funds to help secure our purchase only to find that the pathetic service we had received and gross mis-selling of their products had locked out funds in savings bonds completely against what we had been advised. We had finally been encouraged after we raised a complaint and had encountered the first competent member of staff that actually seemed to be helpful, only for the complaint to be seemingly ignored. We had requested, quite reasonably that we received full written confirmation of our complaint and transcripts of the calls as confirmed by the agent on the phone. To date the only signs of progress in this complaint are a text advising they will be in contact with us shortly"" that is now 6 days old! If that's their definition of shortly I dread to think what a lengthy delay would be.Currently we are still waiting to hear from the Bank and at this rate we will never get to buy the dream house that we can clearly afford all due the banks incompetence. I feel sorry for anyone who is still dealing with this cold and heartless organisation. Shame I can't give them no stars as one star seems far too generous at the moment. """
Customer_765, Worst Customer Service EVER , To talk to the bank is next to impossible! My husband has been on hold for an hour and still holding!!!!!! 
Customer_766, Cost £120 in International Calls When Nothing Wrong! , My daughter is travelling in the US. Her ipod was stolen so went to buy a new one but the transaction was decline. At home in the Uk we get an automated call from BANK_NAME saying she MUST call them. We check with BANK_NAME -she MUST call them. So she calls but is put on hole for so long that she runs out of call credit. Calls again. On hold for another 25 minutes but the man on the end of the phone can't hear her clearly so hangs up. Calls again. Put on hold for another 30 minutes only to be told there is nothing wrong with her card. Total phone bill £120. Unbelievable. Disgraceful. 
Customer_767, Worst customer service with the highest overdraft fees. , Worst customer service with the highest overdraft fees. It’s better to get a payday loan than using the BANK_NAME overdraft. Changing to BANK_NAME today!!! 
Customer_768, EVER MADE AN ERROR AND TRIED TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK ," We made an error making an online payment by inadvertently hitting the confirm button, within 30 seconds of realising the error, we phoned BANK_NAME and asked them to stop the transaction and put the money back into our account.  Their comment was the money was already in the recipients account and they had no systems in place to recover the money.  It is amazing that when they are owed money they can take it out of anyone's account when they feel like it!!.    Are we the only one in the world to have ever made such an error?    So much for BANK_NAME!! Incompetence or unwillingness to help? - they are both as bad as each other. "
Customer_769, Don't bank with BANK_NAME , Don't anyone bank with BANK_NAME not only they are the worst bank in England they have surpended mine and my 81 year old nan account on top of that they have put a loan into her account of £7500  witch she didn't want they are accusing me and my nan for doing this loan 
Customer_77, Slow and inefficient. ," In 1992 I walked into a Citibank office in Miami, Florida with $100 in my pocket. Less than 20 minutes later I walked out with a freshly-printed bank card with my name on it. Fast-forward 25 years to 2017. I have a check for a quarter million euros that needs cashing, so I thought it would be a good idea to open a BANK_NAME currency account rather than let the bank automatically do the exchange into pounds for me and rip me off for a 2.5% commision. It's been almost one month and a very, very long interview in the bank since I tried to open the account. Only three days ago I got an email from BANK_NAME letting me know the account had been opened and they'd be in touch, but no further information was given--no account number, nothing. In these three days nothing has come in the mail. In the meantime my money keeps losing value to inflation rather than gaining it in the stock market. I'll be looking to open a currency account with a competitor tomorrow morning. I wouldn't be surprised if it was all sorted on the same day. I'll probably short BANK_NAME's stock as well. "
Customer_770, BANK_NAME have the worse customer service and the staff are so unhelpful!! ," BANK_NAME are the worse bank ever with awful customer service. I opened an account with BANK_NAME in store with a deposit of over 500. I had all my letters come through, card, pin and Internet details, and pin for Internet banking. When I opened the pin for Internet banking it ripped so I couldn't see the number. I phoned the 0845 number and the customer service staff are so rude! They only asked me 4 questions which was full name, address, account number and date of birth. The lady said please hold, and came back about 5 mins later saying I have failed to pass security clearing and had my account blocked!!! She never said what or why I failed, but I couldn't use any ATM or online banking to get access to my cash. After the weekend I went in to branch and saw the branch manager who looked like she couldn't give a damn and I withdrew all my deposit. Please guys stay well away from BANK_NAME!! You have been warned :-) "
Customer_771, the most unhelpful bank - terrible customer service , 3 days to make a transfer from my BANK_NAME account to my other bank - Their phone banking 0845 number always get you back to a call center in India where a very nice chap keep asking you if you had a good day - the answer is no - my money is still not transfered - you try to call back the fraud line number to ask information about your money - no one bothers to pick up the phone - You try to call to complain - a lady with an icy  voice tells you .......to call that  very same number again -Kafka would not have done any better I will switch to Santander 
Customer_772, Honestly the best banking experience I have had! ," I am surprised to hear so much negativity on here, I have genuinely never been so impressed with a bank before.I use BANK_NAME for my personal and business accounts and find their service spot on, the local branch staff are friendly and the branch manager really does work hard to help when needed. "
Customer_773, Shocking all round service ," My adult son has learning difficulties and autism and when I got through to the Indian call centre and explained that I would be speaking on his behalf once he had cleared security. The advisor was very rude about my son and told me haughtily that any prompting him to clear security that he would terminate the call. He did EXACTLY that. My son was trying hard to listen to someone ask security questions where English is not their first language. When my son struggled to answer a particularly difficult question, the operator hung up on him. My son was very upset and thought he had done something wrong. To say I am livid is an understatement. I am in the process of making a formal complaint. Dreadful company that uses Indian call centres which causes frustration and misunderstanding on both sides. I've happily moved banks to the CO OP I've never had an advisor who's first language is not English and this is much easier to aid communications for my son and myself. Just to add, BANK_NAME  charges for overdrafts are an absolute outrage. There is a petition people can sign on the internet to log your displeasure of these charges. I can't remember who started it or how to sign it but I'm sure if you google it, you will find it. I happily signed it. "

This is causing small businesses to have direct debits not paid and charges . The bank is making a lot of money from small businesses with this activity . I shall be contacting the ombudsman as payments were always in the accounts after 12 midnight latest 1 am .On calling I was told they have a new system and there is nothing they can do whoever the software engineer developed this I would like to say thanks for screwing over small businesses . I was also told monies should be in account before 10am but many are after 12 noon . Disgraceful when we can’t access our monies because the bank decides our money will be withheld until late morning or after noon . It would be interesting to know how much you are making for the unpaid charges since your pathetic unorthodox practice . What have BANK_NAME got To say !!!You should have warned us this was going to take place  and credits would be affected , why is it the debits come out minutes after midnight yet credits go in noon on  The day . You have caused unnessary time and charges to businesses . "

It was like talking to a robot - he really didn't understand what I was asking and then cut me off!

They even had the nerve to tell me not contact them again! I cannot access any of my money and all DD have been stopped.

From what I saw I may of had to book an appointment and then this pleasant man offered to open it up. He was very polite and someone who I felt who I could have a laugh with (well I did anyway). Alongside him he had an assistant in training who was just as nice and I dare say she will succeed in the future. Over the phone they are extremely helpful and there telephone, mobile and internet services are very easy to use and a nice easy to use layout. Great service from a great bank. "

"
Customer_786, I ALWAYS have trouble logging into my account... , I have a priceline visa through BANK_NAME.  The only reason I got it was to get $50 off a plane ticket.  EVERY time I go to log into the account to make a payment it says my password is incorrect....EVERY time!  I have NEVER had this problem with any other financial institution before.As soon as I pay off this card I will cancel it and I'll NEVER have anything to do with this company again! 
Customer_787, very worst ," Its an frustrating and worst bank ever.They hqve cancelled my accounts without any prior info and without any reason. And they stopped my internet banking too and telling that the reason is comfidential. What the bullstuff bank is! Now i ask to return my whole amount which i dont know how much as they stopped my access to account, they are telling not having the balance at the time. Worst experience ever. "
Customer_788, Impressed so far ," We switched from HSBC to BANK_NAME some 9 months ago and so far they have been excellent. HSBC were like a bunch of part time amateurs whereas BANK_NAME have been very professional, helpful and friendly. Our business manager is excellent. "
Customer_789, BANK_NAME bussiness account DISGUSTING!!! , Their charges are absolutely disgusting!!!! ALL SMALL business should avoid like the plague!!! There's absolutely no gain from using the business account and they charge you well over the top for everything. Use a personal account instead and don't let them bully you into believing you have to use a business account! 
Customer_79, The remortgage should have been straightforward! How wrong can you be! ," The remortgage should have been straightforward... 5 months later and tons of OTT paperwork, we are still working out the muddle! Out of date methods, letters getting lost in the post, eg. even to change my password, it's done via post! Been waiting 2 weeks over Christmas to get the letter containing a new pw and haven't been able to log in since!! Tried phoning and waited 15 minutes each time to get to speak to anyone. Both clerks assured me that I'd have the pw in 2 days...This bank needs a big shake! "
Customer_790," Incompetent, stay clear, avoid, robbers. "," I've held a fixed rate mortgage for 7 yrs and to date have that much conflictinting information, they even told the FOS wrong information. In 2012 I paid a 5% lump sum off my mortgage, they then calculated my annual statement wrong. The FOS awarded me a sum for their incompetence. In 2013 I paid a 5% lump and again they have calculated my mortgage wrong, this again has been referred to the FOS. Every time that a complaint is registered it costs the bank circa £500. So complain. They will not forward me a copy of the terms and conditions relating to my mortgage nor will they produce the calculation showing how my revised figure has been calculated. I will get this information via the FOS.Up date FOS has taken up the case, BANK_NAME told FOS case closed. BANK_NAME had to open a new case, offered £100 compensation for getting it wrong but have not released terms and conditions or a reconciliation of my mortgage. They have also reduced my monthly payments, in the last 3 weeks I've been given 4 different figures all of which are wrong.This in tern means I'm being denied the right to over pay my mortgage set out by BANK_NAME. My next step is to take this to the small claims court. ARE YOUR PAYMENTS CORRECT ??? "
Customer_791, Impressed with Woolwich mortgage!!!! ," It only took 15 calendar days from applying for mortgage to official offer!!! And there was 4 wasted days from my wife's employer, by not supplying some documents.So very happy!!! Also super nice to receive text messages on phone for any updates.Only down side was that mortgage advisor is very pushy with selling life insurance as well, makes me feel like bonus or period target more than a human customer.But overall 5 stars.I would recommend them to anyone, they were the cheapest as well.If you do not meet their criteria it is more like your fault than theirs, I guess. "
Customer_792, Charged £8000 by the Woolwich for paying them back early!! , I took out a 2 yr fixed mortgage and change of circumstances mean that I need to move 3 months early. I am being charged an £8000 early repayment fee. All staff say is that it was in the small print when I took out the mortgage. No one will tell me how much profit BANK_NAME are making on this. 'I FEEL ROBBED'. Most other banks reduce the fee over time - I will go to them in future! 
Customer_793, good service , Been banking with them for nearly 14 years and am happy with my personal account service. Special shout out to BANK_NAME in Worcester PArk. So helpful and nice! 
Customer_794, russian roullete with your sanity ," Getting competent staff on the phone is game of russian roullete: a) one call, and you  get an excellent operative who deals with your query expertly and to the point. b) you call, and get a sequence of transfers to their obscure departments, while you initially dialed the number on their correspondence, which was supposed to deal with your issue.Unfortunately, you are more likely to get a a lot of the latter, as BANK_NAME seems to be adept at hiring brainless idiots and training them how to transfer calls between endless departments. "
Customer_795," Inept, disorganised and unreliable "," The business help line arranged for the account manager to call me at 14:30, they never called. When I phoned then they promised to contact me within three hours, again nobody called. This happened two further times. They finally called me at gone 15:00 the day after they had originally promised; just over 24 hours late. Thus, I wasted a day and a half waiting for them to call, during which time I made five phone calls to them and had to explain the story each time - they obviously cannot be bothered to record the details of the concern. They are do not seem capable of providing a service to a small business. "
Customer_796, No money from an ATM , We tried to withdraw 100 pounds from an ATM at Stansted Airport. We got a receipt - but no money. And 2 weeks later no answer from BANK_NAME. 
Customer_797, I paid in my account £700 at the desk only to find out a MONTH LATER the cashier didn't pay it into my account! If I didn't keep the receipt she would have had a nice Christmas present! ," Just came back from BANK_NAME branch in Harborne Birmingham! What a disgrace. The worst customer service I ever had both from the staff and the “Manager” . On the 8th of Nov I paid into my account £700 at the cashier desk. At the end of the month I have received my statement and that money weren’t in. So luckily I kept my receipt and I when back today to ask the bank where the money were. The Miss X which was serving me presented herself as the Manager and after looking up onto the system said that the money were deferred. When I asked how is possible this to happen as I remember she was the same cashier I paid the money with, she said she doesn’t know. So my response was “How can you tell me you don’t know why you didn’t pay the money correctly into my account? What about if I didn’t keep the receipt? There wasn’t any way on Earth I could proof I paid those money in. “She then responded very rudely and started defending herself instead of apologise! So she didn’t apologise and I said to her I want to close my account immediately and would like the details of her Manager. She said to me to take a seat and wait for the adviser as she couldn’t close the account for me (?). I then sat and waited and saw with my own eyes the adviser was walking around the branch and getting ready to go home. I went back to Miss X and asked why is she coming back to me but instead made me wait for half an hour. She said the adviser was with another customer lying straight into my eyes. When I asked for the Manager Miss X said the he “went to collect his children and should be back soon”. On a Friday afternoon – the bank full of people THE MANAGER WENT TO COLLECT HIS CHILDREN! Amazing!Furthermore, when he arrived, he was even ruder than her. He told me he apologise for the wait but he had another appointment (!) . I then told him that I know where he was and there was no need to lie to me as well. I started explaining what have happened but he didn’t want to know as he was already upset that I questioned his absence. I did mention that once the “customer had right” in the conversation and he replayed “Well time has changed”. At the end he closed my account and I asked wouldn’t he at least apologise for the mistake they made and he said “NO I DON’T THINK I HAVE TO APPOLOGISE TO YOU”So in total: No apology for the mistake they made, rude staff at the desk, and EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE MANAGER WHO DIDN’T BOTHER STOPPING ME CLOSING SAVINGS ACCOUNT WITH A LOT OF MONEY IN AND DIDN’T CARE OF LOOSING A LOYAL CUSTOMER OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS! "
Customer_798, BANK_NAME is the most inefficient bank ever. ," I transferred 500usd from my Singapore bank to a UK SEO company on 18th of October. Unfortunately, their bank is BANK_NAME. After 4 working days, they called me back and asked me what's the purpose of the transfer because I mentioned Yangon"" as the website we were working on is about Yangon Guide. And they asked strange questions like if there is any connection with Iran. I mean really? How is that Yangon has anything to do with Iran. They couldn't be more ignorant. On 25th"
Customer_799, Best Bank I've ever banked with! ," I have banked with few banks including world most known, however no other bank could ever meet my satisfactions as BANK_NAME always does! Whatever I need, whatever I want, I can always get it sorted on the day with a bank with no hassle! Also is great to know when I call the bank over the phone I get to speak with an ENGLISH speaking person, rather than a foreigner whom I cannot understand! Enough Said, in my opinion BANK_NAME scores 10 out of 10 for me! "
Customer_8,customers as money cows,"i have had many interactions with BANK_NAME over the past 40 years both as a customer and a shareholder and have never had anything but terrible customer service - they persuaded me to stay with them when they acquired the Charles Schwab stockbroking business and for 2 years it was not bad. From 2007 it went downhill and has recently hit rock bottom, Even as a shareholder their actions cost me money. It has over the decades become apparent that here is a company run for the benefit of the directors, with little ethical direction. When I started University in the 1970 BANK_NAME was portrayed as a support of apartheid, and now with having been fined, and with legal cases against them  in the pipeline the quest for making money regardless of the cost is only too apparent. Even if their customer services department want to help you, they are hindered in doing so. I wish that BANK_NAME would put 5% of the effort they put into ducking issues into sorting them out and they would be much better."

Customer_800, The Patriot Act has somehow taken over this bank. ," After spending 1hour to read, answer, and fill in the application to open an on-line CD, I was rejected and told to call.  They said they wanted me to fax my DL, SS Card, and Utility bill for their review and that they were going to keep the application for seven years on file.  I said I did not have a fax machine or desire to send all this new information previously undisclosed and requested that they just delete my application.  She said no and I then spoke to a supervisor.  He said it was the Patriot Act that made them keep my account numbers and SS # even though we had done no business.  I am hard put to understand why they think that I (international threat) would want to deposit my money in there bank just to get even with them and the US.  I will probably need my money to pay my fine to Obama Care (Affordable Care Act). "
Customer_801, wish i could give a ZERO ," I applied for a basic account, was told to send some IDS (copy's) bank statement, driver licence etc etc, filled in the form with my signature and posted the items 3 weeks ago, heard nothing as of yet, walked in to a Birmingham branch and a rude assistant wouldn't help me with any updates, she said you will receive a letter, she didn't even ask my name etcthen I phoned the customer service number, OMG I was passed to around to 5 agents and finally some Asian guy told me he cant find me on the systems at all, and no record of and post from me (this is a pre paid envelope BANK_NAME give you),every number I dial, ends up in a dead end, BANK_NAME have gone down the pan, so so so bad, and now I have some lost IDS thanks for nothing BANK_NAME "
Customer_802, Worst bank ever! Stay away! ," This is the worst bank I ever dealt with. I applied for many credit cards from other banks and I never had hard time like I did with BANK_NAME. I have an excellent credit score (780). After my application, I got a phone call from them saying that every thing looks good but they still have to verify my identity. Asked a couple of questions then asked to mail a copy of my driver license, social security card and a utility bill. I sent all of the documents, and It has been more than 2 weeks now and they still say they never received them. Customer service is terrible. No way to talk to any manager. Also they do a hard inquiry  on your credit (which makes you loose a couple of points) without telling you.. "
Customer_803, Absolutely outstanding customer service!!! ," Made an appointment in a local BANK_NAME's branch which was extremely easy. Had my appointment today to open an account and the adviser was nothing but helpful and did not at all make me feel rushed, infact it was like talking to somebody i had known for years. She helped me set up all my mobile banking apps and she couldn't of possibly done more for me, went well above and beyond her call of duty! I certainly know the difference between good and bad customer service with banks after been a very dissatisfied customer with HSBC. I was so happy with the service i have received i have been recommending this to family and friends. I would certainly love my feedback been passed on. Extremely happy i now have a bank that seems to care! "
Customer_804," BANK_NAME are going down the pan, recommend first direct "," I recently went to close an ISA which i hadn't used for a while in order to open a new one with a better interest rate with a different Bank. The personal banking person talked me out of it and showed me that I would have a really good interest rate on my savings if I were to move them into it so I did. within a month of adding my savings to the account I had a letter saying they were going to be reducing my interest by 1% effectively making my ISA worse than everywhere else. so I have basically been stitched up. Now that I have added to this ISA I cannot open another until april.I have been with since 2000 and have slowly become less pleased with the service and products they offer. All of there products seem to be more expensive than other banks and they do not value the long term customers. they are basically a bunch on con men just looking to make money out of you. I will be slowly moving all my accounts to a different bank, wouldn't recommend anyone to open a new account when there are so many better banks offering better deals "
Customer_805, Mixed experience but very unhappy with BANK_NAME ," I've been applying for the Career Development Loan with BANK_NAME so I can start my masters at the University of Manchester in September. You can't apply for the loan until 8 weeks before the course start date which is stressful in itself but after having applied things only got more stressful. I sent away the application internally through BANK_NAME which the branch ensured me would be quicker and more secure, the people at the branch were very lovely and helpful. However, when I rang to enquire about the progress of the application the service I received on the phone was very abrupt. I rang again at a later date to see if there was any further progress and was told that my application had been denied on the basis of a single 'returned item fee', however, this returned item fee was due to a third party error - I mentioned this on the phone and was told I could appeal within a month and reapply in 3 months. Of course reapplying is not an option given that the start of the course is in September (and it's not like I could have applied earlier given that you're not allowed to do so) so my only choice is to appeal. When I asked how to appeal the advisor wasn't very helpful, just repeating that I could appeal within a month and reapply in 3 months, at this point I was very upset and in shock since I don't have any debts, I've always stayed within my allowed overdraft (which was necessary since I'm doing a masters degree currently and needed to pay for rent and living expenses on my own as I can't get benefits as a student) and the single problem was due to an error that wasn't my fault, at this point I just said goodbye and hung up the phone. I had to call back to try and get someone to tell me exactly what I needed to do to appeal, I wanted to do it as quickly as possible as I didn't want someone else's error to affect my entire future. I eventually managed to get someone to explain explicitly what I needed which required a great deal of coaxing (as no one had explained the first time around) and organised it all within a day and it was sent off again internally (again the staff in branch were really great and helpful), I rang to ask whether the appeal had been received and what the process was for looking at appeals and was told that they hadn't received it and that someone would call me with the a decision, they didn't tell me how long it would take or what the process was. I'm so stressed about it all and so angry that it was rejected on this basis as I've spoken to other people who have been maxed out on their credit card and overdraft and still received the loan. My brother used to work in a bank and he told me that they often operate tiers of quotas, finding any reason to reject some within a certain tier - I sincerely hope that I haven't been put through this for the sake of quotas. I'm trying to complete my dissertation, find accommodation  and prepare for a course I'm not even sure I can do and sort out this loan. I'm so worried and upset that every time I've spoken to BANK_NAME I've been made to feel like I'm inconveniencing them by calling, but this is my entire future. Why is there such a discrepancy between the service received in branch and the service over the phone? "
Customer_806," URGENT, Please read AVOID BANK_NAME! "," I never thought this would happen. as you can see I bank with barcalys and it dont seem to be a very good bank to bank with. I have been missing money from my account a few times before and everytime I complain BANK_NAME never sort it out. I have wrote to them about 2 months ago and they have not replyed back yet.  Well last month they suspended my account so I couldn't do anything with it, take money out, put money in , or even pay my bills. I had to wait 2 weeks to get hold of my money after making loads of phone calls and having to go through security and waiting ages on the phone and dealing with rude people on the phone. Just 2 weeks ago now they decided to suspend my account again I called customer services again they had put me tthrough to the right department that deals with these things. I asked them why is my card suspended again and told me to read my terms and conditions, because they can suspend people accounts whenever they want to and they dont even have to tell me why. Well ok so now I need money I asked if I could get some cash out they told me I had to go to the counter and I will be able to get cash out. Well I got there showed my id and everythin and now the people at the branch are telling me that I cant take any cash out because my account is suspended I nicely explained to them that the people on the phone sayd if I wanted some cash I could get it at the counter. They still not wanted to give me cash then they were saying that I needed proof of address but i still cudnt take money out my own account. Lol. Well but its not funny at all. I have a baby at home she just turned 1 I had no food electricity or gas in the house I make my shopping weekly.  I explained all this to the branch manager in tears and all he did was say he understands my situation but still  I couldnt get any cash out. I dont have any family living near me to help How could this be right it is my account. After this is all finishd I will close my account with them. I do not recommend BANK_NAME to no one. They put you in situations you should never have to go through. "
Customer_807, Very Poor Customer Service - not impressed ," I work as an accountant and 'used' to love the BANK_NAME Brand. Last year I got a package premiere account and paid £17.50 per month. The sales pitch was it would be useful for me and there would be benefits .. so I signed up. eg insurance, breakdown cover, airport lounges, However it dawned on me that my household insurance would cover for items (which by the way was with BANK_NAME) , my company car breakdown covered my my employer, etc etc. So i stopped the account for premiere. I asked for an explanation to why I was sold the product given the points above . The reply I got was that I signed the customer contract and entered an agreement. I tried to ring to speak to the writer of the letter and was told very curtly - that we have made it clear we have closed the matter in our file and the writer of the letter is unavailable' . So in short - get lost!In the past I used to recommend BANK_NAME to clients.. but this stopped. Part of my frustration is the money but more the treatment to value me as a customer. Step by step I will move my various products to other companies. They are just rude and don't listen. """
Customer_808, What a nightmare ," I recently got married and had to change my details with BANK_NAME, I have been with them for 8 year and never had a problem until now, I went into a branch with my marriage certificate and all other documents I needed to do the name change. All went well and they did the name change with no problem. I then get home and now have to phone to change my details on my online banking and mobile banking, the lady that I spoke to for the online banking changed everything for me and was quite pleasant, she then transferred me to the mobile banking call center, what a rude woman I spoke to, she could nearly speak english, but I then discovered that the woman in branch has spelt my surname wrong ( even though the spelling was right in front of her). Whilst on the phone to mobile banking the advisor was getting extremely rude, and then proceeded to hang up on me, I tried to call back to speak to management, but was transferred from one advisor to another. Due to all of this I then had to return to the branch to change my name all over again, then call online banking again, and doing all this at 8 months pregnant. I am dreading having to change my address incase your staff mess that one up too. I am now looking at changing banks as I can't be bothered with a bank that treats its customers like dirt they have scraped under their shoe. I suggest you get your staff sorted before you loose all your customers. Oh and sort out your charges, they are ridiculous. "
Customer_809, AVOID. Terrrible ," The worst bank. Avoid it. Unqualified members of staff, they do not know themselves what they are doing. Charge me monthly for nothing. Closed my account without informing me of upgrades, still waiting for a new card to be dispatched (5 days) left me without money and explanation.Spent ridiculous amount of money on Call Center, for what? To speak to a bunch of unqualified people who were putting me on hold and transferring me between each other. AVOID AVOID AVOID. "

We all have this type if insurance hoping never to need it. but if you ever do, the last thing you need is a major battle on your hands to rightfully claim what you have been paying premiums for years for.Even as a customer of 40 years does not seem to count as any form of loyalty. BANK_NAME seemed quite happy for us to risk losing our house just to avoid paying what was due....Gary CruiseAn update to our situation from #6 above. The Financial Ombudsmanicon has made their decision and come down in our favour. Informing BANK_NAMEicon that they should compensate my wife something in the order of over £5'000. after 8 to 10 weeks, we finally received a cheque for £200.. Thinking that this was the end of the matter.. after getting the Ombudsman to investigate again, we then received another cheque for £1'200.

Customer_811, BANK_NAME bank and good service , I have been with BANK_NAME since 1982 and have had very good customer service with them.on the 3 occssions I got myself in trouble with unscrupulous websites BANK_NAME staff helped me fill in the appropriate forms and after the legal requirement for them to allow the websites to respond on each occasion the money was put back into my account.they have also been helpful on several other occasions when I needed a loan or assistance.I only stopped short of given them 5 stars because of their mortgage facilities which were with the Woolwich which did not offer the slightest discount for a long time BANK_NAME customer which I thought they should.But overall I am very happy to stay with BANK_NAME and definitely recommend them.john tandy 
Customer_812, Terrible , The customer service is disgraceful.  Just all together awful and I intend to close my bank account with them immediately. 
Customer_813, Customer service? , I am one of those people who switch their accounts between bank to maximise deals.Firstly I would say I have banked or had an account with all the major high street banks in my years.1. Change BANK_NAME overseas customers service telephone line back to the uk.  The advisors cannot converse with their customers and sometimes you are left wondering why you have bothered telephoning the bank in the first place. I would say If you have watched The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel a scene from the movie is where she teaches the call centre on how to deal with customers as human beings.2. Great customer service in branches I have found.One advisor called anne at st anne square manchester delivers excellent customer service each time I see her. 3.  I haven't yet had any issues with the product or charges. So I cannot comment.  From reading the terms and conditions they seem fair.

Customer_818, Friendly branch staff but impossible phone and email customer service. ," If you've got a query, head to your branch or call them directly. Calling customer services is like entering a labyrinth - you never know where each 'I'll transfer you to a colleague' will take you. Tried emailing for a general query as I was overseas and knew it would eat up my money and time to call (if the information - on international transfer charges - is on the website, it's really well hidden). What followed would have been funny if I hadn't been looking for a relatively fast response.The first email was an irrelevant template. There's no dedicated advisor so your reply goes right back into the general system. The second email was an acknowledgement of my complaint and a reassurance that they were taking my concerns very seriously (I didn't complain!) and still no information on the topic I was asking about. They also said that they would have to investigate this and respond in writing - a waste of manpower and paper for a complaint that does not exist. The third email was the same template that I received in Email 1.In the end, I jumped on the phone to the number they suggested and after three different advisors in two departments, two of which couldn't say for sure what the answer was and gave me different numbers, I think I got the information I was looking for.Sigh. First Direct could teach you a think or two (or ten).Edited to add, complaints procedure handled very efficiently, which is great, but doesn't solve the problems at the beginning of the customer service experience. I would still warn people away from BANK_NAME until customer service has been improved. "

After over 70 years of being with this bank as a family, we are closing our accounts with no expression of regret whatsoever from the Bank. My final £2,000 of debt to them I shall pay off with a sackful of pound coins.Their fault  - in spite of us commissioning a full survey from them for a purchase in 2010, we were sent an incompetent man who was no better than a valuer. Thereby the Bank protected their investment/loan, but failed to protect us...as the house was actually in a state of collapse...a 15th century timber framed building riddled with death watch beetle.

Managers now have no authority to overide the computor credit assesments even whenthose assements are demostrably wrong. Premier customers now treated like all others..... a huge change to the original offering.How difficult would it be to offer the original Premier Service at a higher cost? Survey your Premier Customers and see what they say. I for one would be happy to pay £100 per month to return to the original Premier service levels. 
Customer_823, Easy Use on the Internet , Very secure an easy to use and has a very unique design to it..would always recommend... 
Customer_824, Telephone Banking system don't exist!!!! ," Well, i was in the middle of the street and i went to a cash point and realised i had no funds on the card and i needed to transfer from my savings No panic! BANK_NAME is an amazing bank! They have a Telephone Banking System to which i subscribed in case i was in the conditions i was that day. I called right away, but i was put on hold... and here the best... There were 3C that evening, It was cold and i have been on the line waiting in the streets for almost 18 minutes and 52 seconds!!!  At the end i had to hang up without speaking with an advisor nor sorting my money problem out, plus spending almost £5 for this very useful and helpful phone call!I complained 2 days after and they replied saying it was a mere accident. On top of this they wrote that Telephone Banking Service and Customer Service are the same team and the way they manage staffing levels can sometimes create this kind of accidents. Of course it makes me feel that staff levels are not managed adequately and I think that if this has happened once it will happen again. Also, it looks like that even if you are logged in Telephone Banking Service you always go through the general"" Customer Service"
Customer_825," Branch staff fine, online service is rubbish "," Have been a customer for many years, I think I would be regarded as a good customer throughout.Recently started to have trouble accessing my balances via the online service and got locked out.  Went through the usual processes and got everything reset.  Then after a short while of no problems, got locked out again, and reset everything.  Then all ok for a while, and, you've guessed it, got locked out again.Couldn't have happened at a worse time.  I was unable to make online payments or transfers.  I spoke with their centralised call centre, less than helpful. So reluctantly I closed the account.  Then got a letter saying they didn't recognise my signature.  Had to visit local branch with passport etc to sort out.  Believe me my signature has never changed,  even the branch staff said that when I called.No attempt to 'save' me as a customer.  Clearly just a commodity, but the most concerning thing for me was the temporary inability to get to my money. "
Customer_826, BANK_NAME: my experience , I am a happy customer of BANK_NAME.  I have been a beneficiary of their online and telephone banking services. Whenever I visit the branch near my home I receive a good customer service. They respond really well to queries and provide quick service. 
Customer_827, Avoid if you are a business. ," ignorant staff, rude service and very slow. would use a bank in the Gobi desert before I use these monkeys! "
Customer_828, Could be better ," Had some issues but the bank manager personally took charge of the issue and resolved which i was pleased about, but there current account standard charge is a bit expensive for the small services they provide. "
Customer_829, BANK_NAME bank - poor service , I've been with BANK_NAME for years now and it is only lethargy that keeps me with them - I feel the service is pretty poor and their charges are a disgrace. I have my mortgage and my account with them and I can't be bothered changing as all banks are the same these days. 
Customer_83, The crappiest bank ever , The crappiest bank ever. Can't be bothered to help you ever with their customer service. Always ask for another bloody password that you're never using and tell you to wait a few days just to transfer some money when their app is not working. Shi*tiest APR for long time clients.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Customer_830, A bank that treats customers like s***  and give you minimum information... Avoid like a plague , They put your account on review not giving you any brief information why and block your account for every little reason. Example tried to setup Apple Pay and they froze my account for almost a day. They customer service are least helpful. 
Customer_831, Worst bank and customer service in history ," I took a 20 mile trip and an hour in the branch to open two help to buy ISA accounts, we deposited money in cash.. a week later, I get a letter stating my account has been closed for no reason whatsoever. I called BANK_NAME to complain and the complaint department called me back and stated the reason was they did a review and that the bank decided they didn't want us as a customer. That was the only reason given. This is discrimination and appalling for any bank to do!! They can close your account without any reason whatsoever!! "
Customer_832, AVOID banking with this BANK horrendous pathetic poor service , Have been a BANK_NAME customer for over 20 years and have 2 business accounts with them. From one day to the next they froze my business account with tens of thousands of pound in it. NO REASON GIVEN not in branch and not on the phone .No call of warning or explanation of what is going to happen .Bills can't be pay purchases can't be made. When I put in a complaint they called to say they are closing the complaint  and if I an not happy I should go to the FSA !!!( 8 weeks before you can even lodge a complaint ) They said it could take 10 days or more to even write out to explain . DISGUSTING. Awfully rude people . KEEP A MILLION MOLES AWAY

Will never use this again 
Customer_838, A bank thats lost direction. ," Hi have been banking with BANK_NAME for about 6 years. I moved my accounts from BANK_NAME to BANK_NAME and initially it was a good experience. However consistant failure to listen to instructions have taken its toll on my relationship with the bank. Particulary business banking. They took away the business managers, and centralised it into this call centre 'team' who barely understand the difference between a sole trader and ltd company status, and that is worrying. I have asked several times for my account details to be changed from a previous sole tradership name to the correct ltd companies name, that should have been when i opened the account, its at companies house and they still get it wrong!Never have i met such a bunch of badly trained, disinterested bunch of advisors. Plus you close branches so local businesses cant access convenient locations to deposit cash and do general day to day banking. You havent got a clue, business banking is NOT the same as retail banking and we NEED and DEMAND our branches back.I get cross now everytime i walk into a branch of BANK_NAME, becouse you have 15 or so staff standing around with ipads, with some sickly cheesey grin on thier faces all unable to do anything but pester you as soon as you walk into the bank. These people would normally be at other branches, the ones you closed beforehand actually doing a job like paying money in for you or helping with business matters. BANK_NAME was once an organisation that helped you, it was a well oiled machine and a service you could depend on. Now it's just a shallow brand name, with no direction, no actual value to the customer, and is a husk, a shell of what it once was. It wont surprise me if they end up with bottled water behind the counters and start serving cake to customers instead, they are that confused with their identity. I only bank with them because i dont want to have to inconvenience my loyal customers by changing banks again.BANK_NAME PLEASE TAKE NOTE. AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT....PLEASE.. "
Customer_839, HOPELESS BANK_NAME , Not even a 1 star.Applied for a buy to let mortgage. Surveyor claimed no demand for let property in the area (Windsor). We have owned the property from new for 33 years andit has been let out every year since. Bank and surveyor have not got a clue.The banks have just become dysfuntional.Try the Metro Bank.  Much better and expanding fast. 
Customer_84, Absolutely disgraceful customer service … , Absolutely disgraceful customer service ..not yet recieved refund when atm swallowed my cash phoned on four occasions fobbed off with a different answer each time attempted to lodge complaint first time left on hold then phone cut off second time total call was 50 mins long left on hold for over 20 whilst advisor sought advice! !! Asked for manager to ring back as concerned about phone charges ...still waiting. ..for money and manager ..they treat customers like dirt 
Customer_840, Can't believe how they treated me at… , Can't believe how they treated me at Redcar branch am disabled travelled from guisborough to open 2 accounts took all proof of ID.and statements from existing bank. Advisor said could not open accounts cos statements not posted to me. I got them from my bank that day. Was so shocked  went to Lloyd's with same id opened account within 10 minutes. . Went to post office opened another account in ten minutes. They were good to me as I'm disabled. BANK_NAME treated me like dirt. Lloyd's and post office said it was disgusting how BANK_NAME treated me. 
Customer_841, What the actual fck? , So now you can’t pay anymore cash to an account in bank branch. What the actual fck? What about for people that want to pay rents and don’t owe a bank card. This is totally bullish and they are bothering me so much with the letters to apply for an BANK_NAMEcard. I don’t want that. If I would like to apply I would do that myself. Not recommended! 
Customer_842, Overall BANK_NAME has been a good bank… , Overall BANK_NAME has been a good bank for me. I've had a few hickups with them but they resolved them and also offered a goodwill credit.What I probably like the best with BANK_NAME's is their in-bank statement print-out and account service which you can use on your own. I wish all the other banks had the same. You just pop your card in the machine and you get the option to print out statements. And the archives go back by about 2+ years. What I dislike about BANK_NAME is the online account access. There seem to always be a problem with it. I don't use it anymore because I always have problems logging in. Luckily for me BANK_NAME's is around the corner so I don't need the online service per say but otherwise it would be pretty frustrating. 
Customer_843, Stressful experience! ," I am a new customer and wanted to use the cashback offers. However when I try to use them I am given a message saying access is forbidden.I spoke to customer services who said I need to upgrade to BANK_NAME Blue in order to be able to use the cashback. I know this is not correct as it says the following on their website;“if you’re registered for BANK_NAME Blue Rewards you could earn an extra 1% cashback”. This suggests to me that you don’t  need BANK_NAME Blue to get the initial cashback,I then tried using the Livetalk option throug the app which I have to say was abysmal. I tried 8 TIMES to get a response and each time they took so flipping long to respond to my question that the app timed out and I had to start again.One time the agent did not respond to me at all during a 12 minute chat.Low and behold this morning I get an email thanking me for registering for cashback offers which I did not and I  not a BANK_NAME Blue member so this contradicts what I was told by customer services.I have now given up and will be moving my banking to a bank where the customer services know what they are talking about. BANK_NAME used to be a good bank but they have declined rapidly over the last few years.They are spending too much on their digital offering and not enough on their customer services plus removing counters from their branches and not even opening on a Saturday! Terrible bank! "
Customer_844," BANK_NAME Home Insurance (actually Aviva), Legal Expenses - AVOID waste of money "," BANK_NAME Home Insurance - Legal Expenses coverWhat a deceitful company and waste of time having this cover. First I was never dealing with BANK_NAME as it turned out it was Aviva, who do everything they can to be unhelpful and basically avoid wanting to pay out. I am appalled. Horrid experience. This has now cost me £12,000 in legal expenses and I won my case on all for counts.You take out legal expenses cover for peace of mind in case its needed. The amount of stress they put me under never ever again. Deceitful untrustworthy company and I am also a business customer with them too, so I will now look to move everything away from them as soon as possible. "
Customer_845, Stole my money ," Stole my money, cancelled my debit card last week and said they are stealing it for 10 days under review, have never done anything dodgy on the account they left me with ZERO out of all wages and a recent loan from relative which is for a operation which I can no longer have. This has seriously affected my health and on top of that they have put me in debt now. It is the worst bank I can say that from experience from a few but this is ridiculous, best bit is they couldn't even tell me why they have done this. Absolutely discraceful behaviour from a bank. I hope you get televised sometime about your operations as I will glady stand against you. Will be looking at a claim of compensation against the bank for stress, bad ill health, unable to get about anywhere including work, no food, nothing!!! DO NOT BANK WITH BANK_NAME you have no control of your finances they do what they want. Forgot to mention, yes they have blocked the whole account, not just the card. I can access nothing, not by counter and not by app, app has been deregistered by them. Have got no-one to really go to so have pretty much starved since last Thursday. The block was by a txt message to my mobile. Say's it all about them doesn't it. THANKS BANK_NAME may as well be homeless!!! "
Customer_846, Recently helped me resolve a complaint… ," Recently helped me resolve a complaint with a recalcitrant German fashion website, Wardow, who refused to refund my purchase after their shipment to me was stolen en route. Under the Visa cardholder protection scheme, BANK_NAME stepped in, contacted Wardow's bank in Germany, and with the evidence I provided to them, obtained a refund from Wardow's bank on my behalf. All in about a week.The process was professional & reassuring and I've got to admit surprising given the banking sector's reputation here in the UK. "

Customer_848, Refused service when we had sufficient paperwork evidence of legal residency in the UK ," I had an appointment with Stephanie Hart at the Bury St. Edmunds branch. Before the appointment, I was told by a customer service representative that I would be able to present my military orders (showing that I am stationed in the UK) as sufficient evidence of my residence in the UK, in order to open a currency account. Despite this fact, Stephanie refused to accept the military orders. I presented to her my signed rental lease, which the BANK_NAME website clearly says is acceptable proof of UK residency by stating, Tenancy agreement (dated within 12 months) from local council or housing association"".

Customer_86, Decent bank ," Decent bank, customer service on the phone is a little limited but they make up for it. Glad to be a customer of BANK_NAME. "
Customer_87, Clueless ," I had received a letter from BANK_NAME about my business account and informed I had to fill in all my business details before 30th Dec.Didn’t understand the reason so rang up their helpline , they stated on about what I had to do but could not understand a word they were saying, so gave up.Rang up three days later and was told that if my details were correct then there was no reason to fill out the form.Joke of a company. "
Customer_88, Worst Bank - Please Avoid for your Benefit ," Personally, as well as have heard from Employees who have worked for BANK_NAME. It is nowhere a bank to be recommended. The branches and their service are completely broken. They still forget you are the customer and you are using them so that they could benefit and profit.When a bank thinks you are at their mercy even before you open an account - what words can we have to recommend such a bank? "
Customer_89, An enduring mystery ," It has long been a puzzle to me that anyone would choose to bank with BANK_NAME.  I closed my own account with them many years ago in response to their poor customer service. Unfortunately both my mother and mother in law bank with them and are too old to change, though both have suffered abysmal service. I recently acquired power of attorney for my mother and gained access to her BANK_NAME account via the Web portal. On trying to make a payment from the account a message appeared saying that I would first need a card reader and that one would be sent to me within 5 working days. Nothing arrived so I tried to send a chasing message via the secure contact facility - and got a message saying I would need a card reader before I could send a message - one would be sent within five days. Again nothing arrived. I have just phoned BANK_NAME Indian call centre and been told one will arrive within 5 working days. I wonder.... What is the point of an internet banking service which does not allow payments to be made, and why do they not send a card with the opening documentation like proper retail banks do?It is difficult to avoid the impression that, for BANK_NAME, their retail operation is little more than a cover for their casino operations, which is where they invest the overwhelming bulk of their effort and talent. "
Customer_9,Just  dont,"Ive been a loyal customer of BANK_NAME Business for in excess of 25 years, there has been a fundamental  change in their attitude towards small businesses in the past three years. Small businesses are nothing but an inconvenience to them these days.   They are unhelpful and simply do not give a hoot loyalty to long term customers , it would seem, does not exist in this organisation.

Customer_90," Not taking the blame of there mistake,disappointed,stressed,inconvenience they have caused us customers "," I'm a customer of BANK_NAME for years and years, we have had credit cards loans etc... lately we been very disappointed with there customer services.On Monday the 4th of 2017 me and my husband went to a branch in Watford with all the documents asked of us to change my married surname and order a debit card for my husband. They took copies of our documents etc... we where to expect our debit cards with in 3/4 working days. We didn't. Sunday the 10th December we want it to use Netflix, we couldn't because my current debit card had been cancelled, so we called customer services, we wore on the phone for about 30/40 minutes till we got cut off, so we called again we wore on the phone again for over an hour, with excuses of my husbands card got sent to the wrong address, but yet they couldn't speak about it because my husband is in a different profile even then we have a joined account. So I asked what excuse have you got for my debit card getting cancelled when I haven't or we haven't received or been informed of any mistakes on your side (BANK_NAME) they couldn't explain, all they wore able to do is pass on and on to different people etc etc... without being helpful or polite or take the blame of there mistakes. We wore in a car accident of Monday the 11th and we need it to pay for a cab(uber) not helpful when I couldn't make a payment with my only debit card which BANK_NAME cancelled without notifying me at all. Still haven't received any debit card. I had to move money to other accounts so we can use our money now I'm over my overdraft limit and they already sent me an email to inform me now much I will be charged for per day. Costing me more money for there mistake. We now not able to move money back to our current account for the incoming payments due. Who's fall is it? Who's gonna pay for all this trouble and stress and inconvenience that this mistake of BANK_NAME caused?!? If  it wasn't for the fact that we got so many payments attached to this account we would of closed and be done with BANK_NAME. "
Customer_91, Go back to basics!! ," Your app is starting to do my head in! CONSTANTLY saying “you have reached your limit on fingerprint ID” ... My fingerprint hasn’t changed within 4 days!

I want to hand my cash to a member of staff who is capable of putting it into my bank account, NOT a machine that keep spitting the notes back at me because of the slightest little mark on the note!! "
Customer_92, Smart Investor  is  appalling ," Smart Investor  is  appalling, over 10 days to respond to an email query and  on line chat never functions, telephone? well so far been waiting over 10 minutes listening to muzak!! Pity because I always found BANK_NAME stockbrokers great. If I could award zero stars I would ! "
Customer_93, Just plain awful. ," the smart investor site is very unreliable. on numerous occasions when trying to deal, the page has crashed and took an eternity to come back online by which time the opportunity had gone. Trying to contact BANK_NAME is also impossible, the live chat is constantly 'busy', the message function doesn't seem to work and overall the site is very, very frustrating. I am now looking at moving my entire portfolio. "
Customer_94, They don't care about the customers. ," My issue with BANK_NAME came when I needed to dispute a charge on my Arrival Mastercard. I won't go into all the details (that's for another bad review...) but it should've been super cut and dry. Apparently, not for BANK_NAME. The whole process was a huge pain, from having to fax them my information (sorry for the hyperbole, but... is this the stone age?!) to seemingly bad communication between their customer service agents, and finally (you see where this is going) to them being unable to credit my card. I'm not sure how incompetent their lawyers are, but they must be really bad... I've had to dispute charges a couple times before with other banks and was able to do it quickly on their apps and receive credit within a week. I thought advocating for the clients/that extra level of protection is one of the reasons why we give our business to credit card companies in the first place. I truly wish I had never given BANK_NAME mine.I'm not going to cancel the card and hurt my credit, but I'm sure not going to use it anymore. It's officially out of my wallet and I wish I'd never gotten involved with BANK_NAME in the first place. "
Customer_95, The Final Straw ," BANK_NAME really is one of the least customer service friendly banks in the UK. The arrogance of the people who run this company is quite amazing. I used to have a business account with BANK_NAME, which cost me a fortune in extortionate fees. But, one day they rudely called me and said they were closing it because they no longer wish to support my business. How strange to turn away substantial profits for no logical reason. I wasn't even given the chance to appeal, and even when I tried to complain it just went back to the person who made the decision.To add to the idiocy at BANK_NAME, they have recently stopped allowing cash payments to be made at the counter with paying in slips, and now require your card to be used. That means friends and family can no longer pay cash into your account. This is another dumb and arrogant decision by a company which is anti-consumer. They are trying to stop customers from paying in cash.I see no reason to continue to bank with such an incompetent and arrogant organisation. "
Customer_96, BANK_NAME has done a huge mistake removing Kaspersky Anti-Virus from their website for the members. ," BANK_NAME as a bank has treated me fine but the reason for the 3/5 rating is due to the recent removal of Kaspersky Internet Security anti-virus free yearly licenses that BANK_NAME used to offer. It's a huge shame that BANK_NAME has caved in to the scaremongering that the Russians are out to get us all and well, it has done some damage now as it has affected clients such as myself who use Kaspersky for protection on Windows/Android.After my yearly license expires I'll have to downgrade to the free version but hope that BANK_NAME brings back the premium version. "
Customer_97, Great customer service Norwich ," Went to a store in Norwich, the ladies name was Lynne turner she was brilliant. Helpful and although busy The whole process felt very personal. There was another younger lady with brown hair who helped, well done! You deserve a special recommendation.... thanks for your help!! "
Customer_98, Incompetent and utterly useless , Against better judgement I decided to approach BANK_NAME for my mortgage application because I was told their processing timelines were quicker than other banks.  They’ve proven to be incompetent on all levels and each time contact is made to provide more information it takes them over a week to review / respond.  Unbelievable to think we live in the 21st century yet they can be so slow and inefficient.  For anyone considering a mortgage with BANK_NAME I strongly recommend you try another lender who is more proactive and capable - you’ll hopefully save yourself a lot of frustration and time. 
Customer_99, totally dishonest bank. supports elderly abuse ," several years ago a relative took her son to a Glasgow car company and used an elderly relative with dementia as guarantor. when family found out both the car company and bank tried to avoid addressing the situation. the bank had phone calls obviously proving the caller was not the elderly relative. the loan was around 12,000 pounds. BANK_NAME knew they were at fault and wiped the loan. we went to the police who said they needed BANK_NAME to file a complaint so they could take it further. The bank refused and the relative got away free of any comeback and never paid anything. They even got to keep the car which soon after was involved in a write off incident probably causing some insurance company to pay them. no justice and certainly disgraceful that a pensioner with dementia was abused in such a cruel way "

Apparently this is a ""security risk"".- After having to call them to tell them my new address"
Customer_852, Never Use BANK_NAME , - They change and upgrade your account without informing you- Interest and charges are applied without notice- To transfer money to a new person still takes 3 days unless you have the chip and pin reader.  Get with the times and start using mobile phones to verify people as do Santander- I have been on hold with customer service for 30 minutes to close an account down- The branch staff in Holborn Chancery Lane Branch are rude whenever I want to access my safety deposit box- Never open an account with BANK_NAME.  Try Nationwide or Santander.

Customer_855, BANK_NAME has been very good to me. ," 10 years ago I was declared bankrupt.BANK_NAME gave me an account and debit card (no overdraft or lending facility of course).  I'll always be grateful to the Acocks Green staff for dealing with me as an adult.Even better: Now that I have earned a 5/5 credit rating, 3 months ago I applied online for a credit card & debit card. They were provisionally approved so I went into my local Hinckley branch and met with a fabulous lady whose card I have lost, sorry.Long story short... I was rejected but she spoke to her manager and they found a flag on my account stopping me from getting credit, and they removed it. Approved right away. I am now trusted again as a responsible adult (and rightly so!). Thank you BANK_NAME.PS: I have been an IT developer for 35 years and I recognise that the BANK_NAME mobile app is awesome and gets better with each update. Apart from the recent visit, I have not needed to go into a branch for 10 years. "

Customer_858, rubbish ," 3 complaints in 2 weeks, first cancel my card for no reason then they take money out of my account for yes they put it back but that’s not the point especially when on the phone for something that was there fault for over an hour then they cancel my direct debit and don’t tell me so I miss a payment absolutely shocking at how unorganised they are looking to move bank they are that bad money probably safer under my pillow "
Customer_859, THE HARD SELL ! ," 3 STARS for LONG QUEUES DUE TO LOADS OF BRANCH CLOSURE'S! Bad for small business which are cash operation !I generally would not bother writing a review on a high street bank as we all know that they,today, it seems are useless and slow thanks to all the branch closure's and they are closing down all their branches and making 'US' even if we do not want to ,go online so they can pay their 'board members'  a pay rise for their 'Brucie bonus' this year AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The reason i am writing a review is i am FED-UP being asked all the time,: do you have home insurance""/""do you want a mortgage""/"" Do you want a buy-to-let mortgage""/"" do you want travel insurance""/""do you own a home"""
Customer_860, Atrocious ," 4 years after a court order stated my name should come off a mortgage it hasn't happened. Why? Well, my ex is considered too much of a liability to have a mortgage on her own despite us now being divorced and despite her living with her fiancé in my house. The Court can't order the bank to remove my name, just the ex to use her 'best endeavours', which means I can't get a mortgage with my current wife enabling us to move to a bigger property to accommodate our 2 children. I don't pay the mortgage at all, I haven't done for 4 years, after I cleared the arrears the ex built up. BANK_NAME keep me out of the loop, put marks against my credit file when they agree with my ex payment schemes and don't bother telling me.  They also put marks against me when payments have been made, promise to amend credit file within 3-5 days; 2 weeks on, the adverse data is still showing.  Can I get hold of them to complain further? No, the agent never returns calls.  When I complain, the complaint is upheld and what do BANK_NAME do? Send me £50 cheque every time. All I want is my name off a mortgage I have nothing to do with for a property I haven't lived in for over 6 years. It's not hard is it? "
Customer_861, 5 stars ," 5 stars: Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone "
Customer_862, Never Have any problems :) , 5 years excellent cooperation :) 
Customer_863, 2 months (and counting) trying to get a replacement debit card ," A catalogue of systematic and human error that smacks of institutional incompetence and fatigue. Over the last two months I have visited branch (out of my own time and money) over 6 times and instant messaged + rang dozens more to try to organise a replacement debit card to get sent to the right address. How hard can it be? Very, apparently- for these staff and their systems. Cards have been sent to the wrong address twice (that I know of- security risk!), and over the last few weeks I've tried to organise them to send it to branch for me to pick it up, thinking that would be quicker and less challenging for them to organise. That was a wrong assumption to hold, as the card seems to be held up even more. Branch manager refusing to take responsibility for the issues bar those which are completely irrefutable and for which I have evidence. On the other issues, I have been called a liar. There has been a complete lack of communication recently, whereas before I used to at least get the fortnightly call to wait another week. I've completely had it with BANK_NAME. Dealing solely with cash (which I have to queue up for in branch each time) has rendered me liable to overspending and theft, and has been hugely annoying and inconvenient. THIS ISN'T A MORTGAGE, IT'S A REPLACEMENT CARD. Ridiculous customer service, I'll be leaving the bank as soon as I graduate. This is the first negative review I've written ever. "
Customer_864, A HSBC cash machine swallowed my card … , A HSBC cash machine swallowed my card on a Saturday and I called BANK_NAME immediately as that's the only card I have.  I was very distressed and rude to the customer service advisor even though my call was answered promply. The advisor was very friendly and ordered me a new card. The emergency money service in which you can get money from a BANK_NAME or Tesco cash point is brilliant as I was able to withdraw emergency cash to tide me over till I got my new card.  I was impressed with efficiency of the whole process which is what you want when a card is lost or stolen.  Thank you BANK_NAME. 
Customer_865, Absolute rubbish ," Absolute rubbish, unhelpful liars, only filling their own pockets, say it how it is, they are crap !!!!! "
Customer_866, THIEVES! FRAUDSTERS!!!!!!!!!!!! ," Absolute scum! You are worse than the thieves that frauded my account! Absolute disgrace, please people steer clear of this bank! They are not for customers! They do absolute nothing to help customers who’s account has been frauded! Anyone can fraud documents and this sad excuse of a bank goes in favour of thieves! BE VERY AWARE! CHANGE BANKS LIKE I DID Thieving Scum! "
Customer_867, Absolute terrible advice ----business … , Absolute terrible advice ----business managers cocked up several times and were about as much help as a chocolate fire guardHaving complained several times and being ignored am now looking for advice on how to complain and claim compensation 
Customer_868, Absolute terrible services ..Will be … , Absolute terrible services ..Will be switching banks now...Been waiting for 6months for them to update my phone.address etc but STILL haven't done it .Been into Shrewsbury branch countless times to update but still nothing other than a shrug of there shoulders and false promises ..Very Disappointed 
Customer_869, STEER CLEAR OF BANK_NAME FOR MORTGAGE ADVICE ," Absolutely appalling service from start to finish with BANK_NAME when doing our remortgage. They lost our house valuation, lost our personal details (who knows where they went!) and then used the wrong house details when making the offer. When this finally got sorted (only after us chasing) they then took money out of our account without notifying us. We were advised that additional borrowing would start in October but we were charged in September. After being passed from pillar to post on hold we were offered an insulting amount as compensation (£100!) that in no way makes up for all the time spent trying to rectify this, nor all the stress and worry. No customer care whatsoever and they just talk in jargon to try and confuse you. I would not recommend this service unless you have your own independent financial adviser sorting things out for you or a lot of time on your hands to rectify their mistakes - which you'll of course have paid a service"" fee for! """
Customer_870, Absolutely appalling!! I am current … , Absolutely appalling!! I am currently on the phone waiting for them to answer it's been 1 HOUR!!!!! It's about a fraud case so I am unable to just hang up and leave it!! Once this is sorted I will be leaving this bank!!!!! 
Customer_871, Absolutely atrocious company to deal … ," Absolutely atrocious company to deal with these days. Incompetent in the extreme.I have been with them for around 20yrs without issue, probably because I never had to deal with them beyond normal banking. I switched current accounts but kept my savers. A few months later I decided to open a current account linked to my savers, so they already know me. The lady I applied with was very good and helpful. But then quite clearly some kind of neanderthal monster got hold of the application and made a real mess of it and nothing went to plan. They started asking me to send all sorts of private information like proof of income etc as if I was applying for a loan, which i wasnt. I told them to get lost, cancel the application and close all my accounts and remove my details from their systems. I then escalated my complaint to head office, which was promptly ignored. They bombarded me with letters, emails and calls from private numbers, just as any scam outfit would do. These have now stopped but only because I escalated my concerns to the ombudsman.I dont know what kind of monsters have taken over the machine in the last few years but you really dont want to be dealing with them. Looking at the one star rating on here over 700 reviews its clear Im not alone. Another British company heading for the dump. "
Customer_872, It’s a shame there isn’t a 0* option ," Absolutely disgraceful bank. Tell you completely wrong information about important things. You get passed from department to department and no one seems to know how to do anything. They are quick to take a payment of £230 that had already been paid early and take it AGAIN but they couldn’t refund it for 5 days yet they took it within minutes when I made the first payment early. They send you letters that are completely wrong! And then tell you to ‘just ignore it, it’s automatic’ staff are rude. The woman asked if I had my bank card on me and I knew she would ask for the last 4 digits and expiry date as I have had to call far too many times for all the wrong reasons so I know the DPA process off by heart. I proceeded to give her the last 4 digits and she said she would need to end the call as I ‘offered information’ even though it would have been her next question.To have to call back and stay on hold for another 20 minutes. And don’t bother putting a complaint in as Karen from the complaints department can’t even call you back with a resolution! At least HSBC know how to treat their customers. "
Customer_873, Horrible customer service. Abergavenny branch , Absolutely rude and unwilling to help a customer who's been at that bank from the age of 14. I'm now 33 
Customer_874, Wouldn't touch with a barge pole ," Account was opened just a few months and during that time they blocked the account twice for suspicious activity (i.e. me putting some funds into my SIPP and paying a couple of guys for some building work) and then subsequently closed the account the day before Christmas, leaving me with no bank account during the festive period.  Even now (10/1/2018) the funds that were in that account have not been transferred to my new account (held elsewhere) despite being told that would take 5 days to receive the funds.  So these funds have been locked up over the whole of the festive period, thanks for that BANK_NAME!This bank historically hava a reputation for poor customer service. To be fair, the staff I've spoken to have been quite helpful, it's the processes and systems in place that are complete cr@p.  The bank is rotten to the core and will never be back despite being a former customer of their private banking arm Coutts. Getting through to their customer service teams is a task in itself, be prepared to wait on hold for 30 mins at a time.  Not sure if the problem is lack of staff or just too many customers calling with issues, either way it's unacceptable, bad management and a shocking company to deal with.STAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS BANK "
Customer_875, Wonderful customer service ," Admittedly I am not a customer with BANK_NAME, so I cannot make a review on their business/bank customs. However this afternoon I visited the Filton branch, and must admit I was very impressed with their customer service. With a very long cue, must of been bank rush hour, and only two members of staff working, the young gentleman who dealt with my request kept a cool and patient head, while dealing with all of the customer in front of me very quickly, and with a warming smile. When I reached the desk, he was very quick with the request, and extremely polite, which I know can sometimes be hard during busy hours, when you are understaffed. Thank you :) "
Customer_876, After 30 years with BANK_NAME I’m off ," After 30 years with BANK_NAME - the last 15 years as a private banking customer I have to say I can’t stand it any longer. It’s awful, internet banking is appalling, the call centre staff are rude and surly and I don’t even feel like anybody cares. The bank will probably go bust eventually so I’m moving my account. Terrible. "
Customer_877, Statement Nightmare ," After 6 years of rubbish service with BANK_NAME, I swapped to Nationwide in June. Sadly my mortgage application then asked for my last BANK_NAME statement and it reminded me why I left. Apparently once you close your account you lose the right to view your own historic banking information. Then ensued an hour of being on the phone to be passed from pillar to post. In the end I was told it would be a minimum of 10 working days before I received said statement and no there is no online way, in 2016, of providing it. Avoid at all costs! "
Customer_878, after 60 minutes and having spoken to 5 … ," after 60 minutes and having spoken to 5 seperate customer care agents and not one being able to deal with the simplest of questions after 22 years with BANK_NAME I've decided I'm closing all my accounts with them. This is not the first time and its simple to difficult to get anything done over the phone. Every call lasts at least 40 minutes and normally they finish with you need to come into a branch"". its just awful service. """
Customer_879, The worst bank in the UK ," After 8 years with BANK_NAME I am officially fed up with their increasing charges and poor customer service. I experienced gradual increase in my account fees, charges on foreign transactions with my credit and debit cards and overall poor customer service, for which I complained without any particular notice on behalf of the bank. They also lost my entire mortgage application and I had to resubmit documents again after they initially acknowledged receipt. Also a friend of mine was a victim of a card fraud and after her accounts were completely emptied within 2 days without that being noticed by BANK_NAME they initially refused to refund her and did so only after she threatened to go to the press. "
Customer_880, After 8 years with them they decided to … , After 8 years with them they decided to close my account without giving any reasons. Worst bank ever for not only closing my account for putting it into default as well after arranging a payment plan. They said i wont be able to open an account with them again lol thank you willnot even if you offer me again 
Customer_881, So slow! ," After bank holiday it took a further 2 weeks for them to process payments meaning nothing was adding up in the mean time and leaving me frustrated. I know that there can be a time lapse after national holidays but that's ridiculous! However, I must say their fraud teams are excellent (they sent me a huge bunch of flowers after discovering my card was cloned in Thailand) and once sent me a cheque for their mistake but that shouldn't have happened with an international bank in the first place. Additionally, attempting to do transfers are difficult without a branch close by or a card reader machine (who brings one of those on holiday?!) Attempted to do an international transfer on holiday and was told I needed to fax it through as they didn't conduct this over the phone (even after correctly verifying all security information) so low and behold, there I was traipsing around an unfamiliar island looking for a fax machine in 2015 after speaking to someone from BANK_NAME for over 20 minutes on an international number to do so!Sigh. "
Customer_882, After banking with this bank for 10 years.. ," After banking with this bank for 10 years( personal account and a society business account I was member of) , now they have closed the society account and treating me like a terrorist. We have some money left in the account and now impossible to access the funds for the society.  I probably, tried 5 branches and have been on the phone to them for hours but without any luck. I can tell with confidence that throughout my life I have dealt with hundreds of companies and for sure none have been as bad as this bank. I have experienced the most useless and rude phone customer service I have dealt with ever. To be honest I be wasting my time to describe how bad is this bank. I   would even get upset seeing their name and branches on the towns and cities.  one single advise from me avoid this bank all the way.. "
Customer_883, Not good ," After having account with them for so many years, my account was suddenly terminated before April. I loose out on the interest and can't find any reason why they do that. None of the customer support can help and even the staff at the bank can't give a good reason. Major disappointment "
Customer_884, BANK_NAME - totally unprofessional  DO NOT USE ," After having my debit card refused whilst making a purchase and knowing full well I had more than sufficient funds in my account I went to a BANK_NAME branch for an explanation.  I was told all my accounts had been suspended and I could not access any of my money from the branch or online.  I was told a letter was at my branch in Egham for me to collect which would explain why.  I went straight there but no letter existed and staff there could not explain why I could not access my money.  The manager was rude unhelpful unprofessional discourteous, I could go on.  His only suggestion was for me to wait for the letter. Over 2 weeks later, 2 weeks of worry frustration anger and more worry I received a letter from the complaints department basically saying they did not want my business and I was to make arrangements to transfer all my funds from them to some other financial institution.  They gave me absolutely NO explanation as to why they had come to this decision but they did make if perfectly clear they would NOT discuss the matter further under any circumstances. At this point I could still not get to my money.  This is what they called a final response letter.  So as you can imagine I am totally disgusted with BANK_NAME, the way they treat their long standing customers, their administration is dreadful, they are not professional and they do not have a moments care for how customers are likely to react to such experiences.  The worry and stress I and my partner have and are still going through is immeasurable.  I still do not know if I will ever find out why but what I do know is that I will make sure other people are aware of how bad BANK_NAME can treat their customers. I will say I am currently awaiting information from the Ombudsman who I contacted at  the very beginning of this horrible business. "
Customer_885, Heartless ," After having my life savings stolen by an ex partner I sought help to repay an overdraft he left me with.  No joy, they didn't want to know.  A smallish overdraft of a few hundreds ended up over £2000.  All bank charges and interest.  They knew I was in severe financial hardship yet not once, after visiting the bank or writing to them, was I offered advice, help with setting up a repayment plan or even a discussion.My current bank are a breath of fresh air.  Helpful and polite.  Not a hint of the unpleasant, demeaning attitude I got from BANK_NAME. "
Customer_886, Terrible timekeeping ," After visiting my local branch to make a deposit, I was pressurised into having a review"". The appointment was set up for a Saturday morning at 9:30.Out of courtesy"
Customer_887, Again this has happened , Again this has happened. Payed cheque into one of their supposedly quick payment machines and cheque stuck in machine. Now have to wait until Monday to see if it is found when engineers are called out.Absolutely useless. Onlying changed to this bank earlier this year and wish I hadn't. As soon as this is sorted will be transferring to another bank as staff to busy and did not seem bothered.Eltham branch 
Customer_888, Left hand and Right hand never met each other. ," Again, BANK_NAME business are totally unable to deal with a simple problem.They lie. Or they really do not know what they are doing. Call this number and they will help. Nobody here can help and we haven't got a manager for you to speak to, let me transfer you to the wrong team. Sorry we are the wrong team, our phone system is not working which is why you got me. I didn't tell you I was the wrong person till you explained everything and I'd read your notes. I'll transfer you to someone who will pass you to the department you need to fix your problems as you have spent 3 hours trying to get help from us. I know who you need to talk to, hold and I'll transfer you when you clear security for the 14th time. Please hold...   sorry this department is now closed and will on open when you need to serve your customers. Thank you for calling BANK_NAME Business help and support. Good bye.Sound familiar to anyone? "
Customer_889, BANK_NAME Business Account ," All I can say that BANK_NAME by far has the worst customer service i have experienced that even includes BT!  As a business customer holding three business accounts with them, and since their re-organisation it has only got worse.  Hours and hours on the phone waiting (no clear contact point anymore).Dropped phone calls. Lost personal details in their internal post (twice!).Very rude customer service staff. So i've had enough and will now go through the hassle of moving all my accounts to another more responsive provider.My advice if you are thinking of setting up a business account with BANK_NAME DON'T - save yourself the hassle! "
Customer_890, the staff are incapable and untrustworthy ," All I wanted to do was open a joint account with my partner and we both have accounts with BANK_NAME. The first attempt was through the local branch. The guy obviously did not know what he was doing. He said he would call but didn't. He had no idea why it was taking so long. I called BANK_NAME then and they said that he never uploaded documents. Eventually, the application expired without any warning and we called in twice to check up on the application. Second attempt, via the internet and post, I have no idea why it never went through, they requested bank statements so I sent them, they sent them back and requested them again, I have called 5 times since. They take your number. They never call back. They have no answers. Ask to speak to someone higher up they say that they will put you through to complaints. If you ring complaints they may give you £50 to make you happy. I'v no debt, I have no assets, my case is not complicated. They are not intelligent people to deal with. Their loss, I'll put my money else where. "
Customer_891, Uncommunicative timewasters. ," All I wanted to do was to transfer a small sum of money from my BANK_NAME account to an account in another bank. In order to do this online I had to use their card reader. The thing has never worked, and,as usual, it told me that my pin was blocked and I must phone the bank. Well, you know what that's like, When I finally got to speak to a human being, a very nice chap told me that he had unblocked both my cards and all would now be well.  All was not well - the cards remained blocked. I phoned again. This time I was told that cards could NOT be unblocked over the phone and I would have to go to one of their ATMs. Was the first bloke just making things up? Poorly trained? Who do I believe? I tried their 'chat' facility. I asked why the card reader tells you to phone the bank if the only way you can get a pin unblocked is through an ATM. The girl replied 'Good morning, Liz. How can I help you?' I re-typed my original question. She asked me if my pin had been blocked (!). I grit my teeth and replied that it had. She asked me if I had been using my card reader. She clearly had no intention of answering my query so I typed back that I was sorry she was unable to answer my question and ended the chat.A transaction that would have taken mere seconds on the HSBC website had taken up my entire morning and left me frustrated and furious. Why on earth do they call this Internet Banking if you have to go to a ruddy ATM (in my case a costly taxi trip into town and back due to health problems) to unlock a pin? And what does 'locked' mean anyhow, since I always use these cards for shopping online, locked or not? "
Customer_892, All we want to do is change our address … ," All we want to do is change our address on my wife's current account. She works long hours, is self employed, and trying to reach the only branch in the whole county that is left is very difficult, as it only opens from 1000 to 1630 Mon to Fri and 0930 till 1230 Sat. And that is all. And they will not do anything after 1600 anyway, as that is apparently when their computers switch off.Four weeks ago she went in with her driving licence and bank card to change the address over, after having to take time off her schedule to go there. She received a print out acknowledging the new address. All sorted, we thought.But no, BANK_NAME fails, again. Her statements and details are still being sent to the old address. As we have recently moved we do not have internet yet at home, and they will not do this over the phone, so the only option they suggest is....go back to the branch. Again. Ten miles from the area where she works. After having problems with them screwing up direct debits (that is taking money out 5 days before they are due) and other problems (cards not working, freezing her account for no reason at all), we have had enough. Problem is: all the other banks appear to be as useless, more concerned with image and adverts, closing branches, and not serving customers. So who do we switch to? "
Customer_893, Account for UK residents living in the EU - JUST DON'T BOTHER ," Although BANK_NAME offer Accounts for UK resident living in the EU, actually opening an account is impossible. I live in Germany and have inherited rented property in the UK. I've tried over a period of 2 months to open a foundation account. Numerous times I have received a letter asking for this that and tother document - ALL of which have been sent twice over. The whole issue is going around  in circles, With every letter they ask for a different document. The (in many cases) legal documents I have sent are obviously flying around on somebodys desk in BANK_NAME's office - my sensitive personal information! I spent over an hour on the telephone - being transferred from one incompetent employee to another, with the only advice to send in the application form again"". Thus ensuring that more of my details cover desks of BANK_NAME offices. The whole horrid situation has just cost me MONEY"
Customer_894, Terrible customer service ," Always experiencing a 'high volume' of calls - read as 'we don't employ enough staff' so expect up to 20 min wait to speak to anyone, staff behind front counters behave as if they are doing you a favour - business managers leave a lot to be desired - BANK_NAME used to be a great Bank but now are sadly lacking in many departments, we're currently looking to change accounts. "
Customer_895, BANK_NAME - YOU CAN'T 'GIVE' THEM MONEY!!! ," Another damning review for BANK_NAME - they won't take my money!!My sister is abroad. She needs money paying into her UK account with BANK_NAME urgently.Many times I have gone into branch with all her details and paid it straight in...not anymore. Third party payments are no longer accepted. YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM MONEY!!!!!!Even though I had all her details, all the relevant codes, and identification for me the answer was NO WAY.I bank with BANK_NAME but did not have my card. Boy am I glad it isn't my main account. They expected me to go home and take another afternoon off work and come back the next day.The only solution. Go to my other bank - HSBC, pay in the money, transfer the money to BANK_NAME with the same details. Smiles all round and done in an instant by friendly HSBC staff.So to the 'COMPUTER SAYS NO' lady in the HALIFAX BRANCH OF BANK_NAME...WELL DONE, THIS WILL BE AT LEAST TWO LONG-TERM CUSTOMERS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE. "
Customer_896, Horrific ," Apalling customer service in the past 12 months - I've been abroad and tried to get cash out only for their fraud team to stop all withdrawals and make it impossible to get in touch with them.  Saturday spent one hour queueing in their Leicester branch, wrote a letter of complaint and got two letters back saying 'they were looking into it' but nothing further, and that's to say nothing of their online problems.  Steer clear! "
Customer_897, Apart from closing local branches down … ," Apart from closing local branches down and waiting nearly 45 minutes for a call to be answered, or and not transferring money to another account when they are supposed too,they are great,,,hahaha...In the last ten years i have had 2 loans off them, the final straw with these CRETINS was today when i wanted to exceed my overdraft by £300 just for a month but was refused...Computer says NO..I never EVER missed any payments on my loans Ever .I remember being 18 and getting a £500 loan off Midland Bank i went and saw the manager who talked to me like a human..Them days are gone sadly..Thankfully i have opened a current account with the bank with that nice black horse... "
Customer_898, Appalling ," Appalling service! I waited on the phone for over an hour to speak to someone about my mortgage and in end hung up. BANK_NAME makes a fortune out of these 0345 numbers, I'm sure it's all a scam and there is nobody answering these numbers.  I spoke to someone in the customer service who also put me on hold and couldn't get through.  So incompetent! He couldn't get through the complaints department either, he told me these people also deal with mortgages. "
Customer_899, Mortgage blunders left out to dry. , Applied for mortgage and explained circumstance of only being employed 3 months and wife having bursary. Was told this wasn't a problem. So we instructed our solicitor to go ahead with our sale. We made offer on property and paid deposit as BANK_NAME told us to arrange mortgage with mortgage advisor we needed to have an offer accepted. So we get our phone appointment with mortgage advisor and when they come to my employment they need 6 months employment record. So can't proceed. After explaining I only had 3 months and was told this was ok. Also every other bank on the high street will accept 3 months wage slips some even only need 1. Not BANK_NAME though. So now if we do not get mortgage through the complaints procedure we will lose our deposit. We will have to pay solicitors fees for us and any cost incurred by the buyers of our property. Also agree with others when they say the computer says no. Also they say we don't want to put u in financial difficulty but by not giving us the mortgage we will have lost thousands. We have had our current mortgage for 4 years never missed any payments for anything and have a very good clean credit rating. BANK_NAME have caused us extreme stress. Shattered our hopes. Plans and dreams of the future. Feel totally depressed and let down. Someone on the end of a phone who does not know you at all ruins your life. We would not have applied for a mortgage and sold our house and put offer on new house if we were not able to afford it. Also wouldn't have moved forward if we had been advised we would not be accepted. After we specifically pointed out our situation to BANK_NAME and repeatedly asked them to ensure it was ok as we were declined by another provider. We were assured it was fine. Lies. 
Customer_900, shocking! stay away , Arnold Nottingham branch and customer service is appalling and gets worse the more i visit!banked with BANK_NAME for over 30 years but seriously thinking about changing! 
Customer_901, Exasperating ! ," As a relatively happy customer of the BANK_NAME Direct Business Banking (Hornchurch) section for a couple of years now and looking to open another business account with them,I have almost given up.After applying online - which is simplicity itself - trying to chase up whether the account has been opened is a complete nightmare.After numerous phone calls in reply to automated messages left on my answerphone,trying to contact the right kid at Hornchurch is virtually impossible.Small wonder that RBS/BANK_NAME are in such deep do-do's ! "
Customer_902, BANK_NAME - Most appalling bank for 50 years ! -  Only 7 billion in debit ! ," As an expat investor, the 1st.2year term worked well. - then they deducted 3 consecutive amounts to HMRC, which i had to reclaim. Details of total other errors would take a lot of space, but in brief  - lost very important papers,advised cheque a/c unavailable,sent online 'cards' that did'nt work,made unkept promises to my complaint letters,[approx  - 25 eachway] queried genuine receipts,failed important statements [ for over 12 months.] and there's much more. SUGGEST remove any money, go elsewhere. - even the FOS could not make them respond to their responsibilities. - 2 and half years of wasted time,and out of pocket ! Compensation received, totally lacking compared to the experience of going through this exasperating period.  - even my 15 'sound' recordings of complaint calls re - their errors were of no impetus .   JUST DON'T USE THIS BANK ! "
Customer_903, E-ISA Nonsense ," As BANK_NAME were offering better rates, I transferred mine and my wife's ISAs to them. That was the easy bit! You try withdrawing some money - then you'll have a problem! The first time it went straight into our BANK_NAME current account, no probs. The second time they could only transfer to a BANK_NAME current account which we've never had (and don't want)  but then said they could pay us because we had level 2 (?) service. The third time they won't even do that - I have to go to a branch. Hang on, what does the E in E-ISA stand for? Worst of all the staff are obviously untrained and out of apparent embarrassment make up a variety of answers as they go along. Usual story though, the monkeys who set the whole thing up hide behind the poor bloody infantry! "
Customer_904," THANKYOU... to Oxted,Surrey branch 601609 "," at around 11.15am today outside the BANK_NAME branch in Oxted a man in a baseball cap diverted my attention,jostled me to one side,and stole my debit card,luckily it had not yet dispensed cash.I was visibly shaken and walked into the bank where I was immediately greeted by a lovely lady on the service desk,who sympathetically took my details down,another colleague was called,another lovely lady,who immediately put a stop on my card and confirmed that no money had been taken,and kindly put an order in for a replacement card.I was then directed to a cashier,another lovely lady,who enabled me to get some cash out.I was offered a chair and a cup of tea as was visibly shaken.I declined but am so very grateful for the service and sympathy I received from these three ladies on this occasion.I can't thank them enough...I would like BANK_NAME to read this and to be aware of the gems that are working at this branch....With much gratitude....Sincerely,Stuart Packer..... "
Customer_905, realy  dodgy bank , avoid  like the plague 
Customer_906, Worst Bank in UK , Avoid BANK_NAME like the plague as all they are interest in is making profit. They have no customer care what so ever and blantantly lie to their customers. Offer no assistance when in financial difficulty and seem to think they are above all banking conduct codes.  They apply charges to accounts and then decides if they deem you worthy of refunds.  Use bullying tactics to get customers to agree to their way. 
Customer_907, Avoid Telephone Banking ," Avoid Telephone Banking, avoid asking for any payment by phone. They make mistakes in recipient details and transfer the funds twice. It causes a lot of problems and I am already one week without 550GBP. Complaints take ages. They don't react quick enough and do not offer any compensation.If you want to have a smooth service do everything yourself by an online system. Do not let them do anything for you, especially remotely. "

Customer_910, Awful , Awful awful awful bank 
Customer_911, Awful bank! ," Awful bank!They have implemented a new procedure for cashing in business cheques in the Stony Stratford branch using a machine or queuing rather than using the deposit point.Today the machine was out of order - you would think this would prompt them to open the deposit point, but no! not only did I have to queue for 20 minutes but when I asked about the deposit point the answer was never!""Clearly customer service does not matter with BANK_NAME"
Customer_912, Awful bank ," Awful bank, lied to, manger lied to me. 2 months to get a bank card to me of which it’s still not here asked me to come down for a private meeting ring the doorbell stood outside for 15 minutes in the pouring rain and no one game would not recommend this bank to anyone run by people who haven’t got a clue "
Customer_913, Customer comes last , Awful liars. We have a business account and branches and opening times are dropping like flys. Im constantly bombarded as I enter the branch to use the automated machines. Its like aying dodgeball trying to avoid the staff. No way am I using the machines after losing £1000 for a week. Also why do they expect to charge me for doing their work!. As for the business team they are nowhere to be seen apart from a chair in ivory towers. No personal service or relationship building with business. To be fair the staff in my local branch are lovely but they just work for a mickey mouse outfit. 
Customer_914, Awful user experience , Awful user experience. Internet banking is the worst I have used; key features like being able to download transactions are broken. When you phone there are long wait times poorly structured automation. When you finally talk to someone it is a computer said no kind of response. Shifting my business account now. 
Customer_915," Awful, Rude, Incompetent "," Awful, rude, incompetent. They wouldn't remove a marker on my account even though they had no idea why it was there. I couldn't move money over the phone or online because of the marker, only through the branch. They pass through department to department without a real regard as to who's problem this is. Just completely clueless. "
Customer_916, Bad. , Bad.I wrote to them saying I wanted to empty and close a lost account...they wrote back with a lie saying I didn't have an account.They then wrote to me to confirm 'we got it wrong' and I did have an account.  Was in branch for about an hour trying to trace the account (due to systems not personnel) in the end they had to submit another lost bank account form to BANK_NAME HQ and I've not heard anything since. 
Customer_917, They've cost me time and money , Bank's have very little to do really. Store my money being one thing and letting me access it another. RBS/BANK_NAME seem incapable of doing that over the last week - Oh I get plenty of apologies but its pretty pointless when the money doesn't show on my account I'm owed and worse still they still manage to charge for all the other elements like interest. Terrible 
Customer_918, Dont go to them for a Mortage! ," Been a BANK_NAME customer for years, applied for a Mortgage with them, paid for the house to be valued. The estate agent they used under valued the house by £15k (£20k less than the exact same agent valued it for 3 month previous) We complained because the agent obviously under valued because seller went with their main competitor - we could back this up with the original valuation and comparison of local house prices . BANK_NAME said there was nothing we could do out it but put in a formal complaint, we did this and 7 months later not heard anything back! wasted our time and our £250  - buying your first house is stressful enough without the upset this all caused  - Very disappointed with BANK_NAME and would never look at getting any kind of loan with them again, everything looks great on paper until they screw you over and do nothing to help you. Got our beautiful home in the end - thank you Abby!( free valuation and better rate) "
Customer_919," Do yourself a favour, bank elsewhere... "," Been trying to open a business account for over a month. Have spent over 10 hours on the phone, been into branches twice, had paperwork lost twice, been assured numerous times that 'this is the last time' I'd have to call the business line.Going round in circles, being asked the same questions by every new person I speak to. Unbelievably bad service.After finally being contacted by them (instead of forcing me to call them and be put on hold daily while at work!) - I got an email to which I replied, only to be told I can't expect a reply from them for 48 hrs. 48 hrs to reply to an email??? How is this acceptable in this day and age?The email states I can use the live chat feature if my issue is urgent. The live chat feature is not working...I've now been told my application is going to be shut down in 5 days if I don't provide a document that I've told many people on many occasions that I don't actually have.So I've made a complaint, only to be told that the minimum time to resolve a complaint is 5 days, and maximum is 48 days.I have previously held a business account with them, in the last 5 yrs, and also have a mortgage with them...Honestly the worst case of 'computer says no' I have ever experienced.

Customer_920, BANK_NAME - reliable and trustworthy , Been with BANK_NAME for 28 years and they do exactly what they say on the box! Keep your account in order and you get no problems. Helpful staff at my local branch and excellent online banking. The ISA rate is good too. They have had their problems but trying hard to give the best service. Well done! 
Customer_921, Just the worst , Been with them 10 years and left now.Everything they do is laced with utter incompetence. The move To williams and glynn is a farce therefore logging in or talking to people there is a spiral where you lose the will to live.Just spent an hour on the phone as they proceeded to completely mess up the closure of my account. 3 phone calls to get closing statements in the post from them and now they say they can't do it - contradicting what they previously agreed.Please if you value your sanity NEVER EVER set up an account with BANK_NAME. 
Customer_922," Good bank, not happy with latest fees but worth keeping "," Been with them for over 8 years, good service so far. Few problems here and there but nothing that wouldn't happen elsewhere.  Opened a business account recently and I felt the lady went out of her way to sort everything for me :) "
Customer_923, BANK_NAME is committing suicide. It won't be around much longer. ," Been with them several years but now in the process of switching. They withheld a payment I made which should have been made within two hours. They said it was for fraud checks but they don't bother contacting you to see if you've actually made the payment. They hold the payment overnight to make interest on it.  When you contact them, they are the rudest people you could ever talk to. I take it management hasn't got a clue what their customer service operators get up to. BANK_NAME is the bank where nobody cares. "

So, what are you getting from BANK_NAME when in trouble...sweet nothings. Unbelievable...what a con; they closed Oakham branch and actually offer NO service on the phone...don't even bother trying! "
Customer_929, Blame RBS not BANK_NAME ," Blame RBS not BANK_NAME.  I have been a customer of NW since 1987.  Until 2000 they were brilliant.  From the time of the takeover by RBS it has been constantly abused to the point that now almost nothing is left of the original bank bar its name.  Its really sad as it used to be so good.  Now even the IT systems are chronically bad as well.  Recently in separate unrelated incidents both my wife and son have suffered from the same Denial Of Service vulnerability on their accounts.  It appears systems in south east asia are trying brute force attacks on BANK_NAME customers online banking accounts.  They don't have to be successful as just 3 failed attempts is enough for NW to block the account even though the originating IP is on the other side of the world.  The upshot is that many many NW customers are being locked out of their accounts even though the sniff"" attack failed.  NW are denying this vulnerability and refusing to admit the source is in the far east.  One of their customer advisors let the fact slip when we were trying to hasten the unblocking of my wife's account.  Then later this was denied.  The account was locked for a week.  The same thing happened to my son a week ago and he has yet to successfully get NW to unblock his account even though they have admitted it wasn't him.  What do you do with a bank like this that puts itself so far above its customers that it doesn't care whether they are unable to access their money for long periods ? My son hasn't been able to pay his rent or get to work.  His car is out of petrol and he is down to £9 in his pocket after over a week without any account access.  I wont even go into the Indian call centre fiasco.  That was what finally caused me to go along with all local branches closing down.  The answer is simple.  As soon as you can walk away.  Close the account.  Go to another bank.  That's the only thing NW will pay attention to. """

Clearly I would have moved the money if I had known it was not safe.Nobody I know can understand this, including my other bank which indicated they would not have allowed the transaction.Apparently this is my fault according to BANK_NAME as I must have authorised this prior according to them!They have pointblank refused to refund the money, absolutely ludicrous, left me with no money to pay the rent this month, not happy with all our tax money, they still continue to be blazay with our money.CROOKSHow the hell they think this is acceptable is beyond me.

Then they cancelled my paper statements and changed them from monthly to quarterly without telling me. Only realised when I needed one I phoned them up and said I had to go to branch. I asked for a statement just for the previous month and got told it was only in branch. I asked to transfer some money to another account but no they can't do that once again it was in branch. Finally I said that's it I want to shut my account but no, you have to go in branch. Both my local branches have shut. My nearest branch is £20+ in a taxi each way and they want me to go there! What's the point in their customer service line if they can't do anything. If withdrew all my money and changed my direct debits and cut up my debit cards. I'm glad I never have to deal with this bank again "

And I discovered it only when I call them back. Close to nervous breakdown with successive calls, someone from business banking told me to  register a complain to solve the issue and insisted that this is the only solution!!!! To have a transaction, register a complain! No, first send millions of faxes, and then register a complain! That's insane! I can't see USD accounts on the online banking.

Customer_965," Terrible opening times, terrible online service "," Find it hard to locate a branch now that so many have closed down. They used to call themselves SatWest because of Saturday opening times, now half of them are closed on Saturday and most of the other half close midday. Online banking is riddled with problems. My new card reader seems to be attached to a debit card I don't possess and never have. The company card which is used every day seems to not be registered with the card reader, so I can't pay an employee and guess what, it's Saturday so my city centre branch has closed until Monday. Joke of a bank. "

I would like to remind you that I am in no way affiliated with BANK_NAME e.g. employee, any family member employee etc.Unfortunately, the human nature is that all the bad review spreads very quickly but the good news never got spread to that speed.Having an account over 4 years with this bank I cannot fault it. Previously I had accounts with BANK_NAME, BANK_NAME, Halifax and Sanatnder. Over the past four years found the following good things:1. Customer service is very helpful all the time. I have some problems with my debit card but the customer service sorted the problem straight away and efficiently.2. I have a personal loan on a very good rate over 3 years. I did lots of other comparison before taking the loan out with them. After 3 months topped up again with better than initial rate.3. Online system is very good. Paperless statement helps reducing the carbon foot print. The quality of the statement is very good, as printed them from color printer and submitted them for proof of address to many organization without any problem.4. Mobile banking is very useful to transfer money to your contacts and withdraw money even if you forget your bank card at home or work.5. Contactless debit card always helpful to tap and go places.6. Webchat always useful if you don't want to call and hold on the line.These are few good things. I must say I cannot fault them any way. My family members are switching to BANK_NAME as well because of the good reasons. Hopefully you find the review helpful. "

This happened once and luckily for them they compensated me but now they're saying ""I've been warned"" like a menacing bully. This behavior is totally unacceptable to me"
Customer_971, Incompetence on an industrial scale , Four weeks ago I noted that my debit card was due to expire on 30 April. I used the 'chat' service in online banking to report that I had not received a new card. A 'person' on the other end of chat told me that the bank no longer send out the cards that far in advance but would process it for me immediately.  When the card didn't arrive within the week I went on chat again I was worried that it may have been lost.  I explained all this to the chat person who admitted that the previous customer agent hadn't ordered my card.  This person also assured me that they would sort it out as they could see that the automatic renewal wasn't active on my account (no reason why after 28 years as a customer). Again after a week no card so phoned this time and got EXACTLY the same story as the previous two contacts and was again assured that it would be sorted out and a new card ordered.  What's more that 'person' told me that BANK_NAME don't automatically issue new cards anymore as they wants customers to contact them and reconfirm their personal details. Ok so now it's the 30th April so I waited until the postman had been to confirm still no card. And phoned.  In short a woman apologised and said the previous staff had done NOTHING she offered to get me a rush card sent out the following day.  Ok I said but I still want to make a complaint.  I was transferred to customer services who admitted they cannot trace who gave me the rubbish info and didn't do their job on previous occasions and cherry on the cake the woman I had just spoken to was wrong.  The bank don't do rushed cards so I would have to wait a week and in the meantime I would need to go to my branch (recently closed) and get cash out.  They are a bank of incompetents and liars I am totally sick of them and will now move my account. 
Customer_972, Fraud department told me I had been scammed ," Fraud department told me I had been scammed for a lot of money, then turned the blame on me please, please stay away,I even phoned 4 times that morning with instructions what to do,to be told this was my first call,they put all blame on me even saying my mortgage provider 10years ago must have sold my details possibly"""" this week "

Customer_975, Incompetent  and deluded organisation ," From the top down.  The CEO makes interested sounds when you complain and then leave matters in the hands of the CEO office staff who just make irrelevant statements about their good intent and finish with the ultimatum that if you are not satisfied you can take up the matter with the Banking Ombudsman.  An error in the working of a newly installed function in their on line banking system stayed up for 3 months despite promises that the IT Dept. were fixing it and the fix, when it came, was to delete the wrongly installed function and not replace it.  Too many complaints on the banks Community Forum"" obviously became embarrassing so they closed down the forum saying that it was no longer needed.    So if you don't like something you can raise an official complaint over which you have no control whatsoever and if you don't like that"

Read reviews - BANK_NAME is good for business banking2.  Complete online questionnaire and submit3.  Text message received following day, to call a number between the hours of 9am - 4pm (received at 3.40pm)4.  Ring number, six times to enable me to navigate around a rubbish phone system5.  Finally speak to someone who I can barely understand6.  Told I need to spend 45 minutes on the phone repeating everything already contained within my online application, but going into 'greater detail' - eh, why?7.  Then I have to go into a branch (despite the fact that I do not wish to bank in a branch) with numerous bits of paper to prove my identity as well as 6 months of personal bank statements - no idea even where my nearest branch is and since I live rurally, it takes me a while to get to wherever the branch is.So all in all I need to spend approximately one entire day attempting to open an account!  Don't worry though I'm only trying to run my own small business and can easily spare that time, NOT!!Compare that to First Direct to who I'm moving my personal account to.  Make application on Thursday, debit card and paperwork received Saturday.  Account operating and switching in place on Monday.  Other banks seriously need to take note of First Direct's excellent customer service.  Honestly though I don't think the banks have learnt any lessons and all this rubbish about they've been told to look after small businesses, is just that 'rubbish'.  They don't care and they have no interest just so long as they continue to milk money from small business to pay their bonuses. "
Customer_978," Avoid at all costs, appallingly bad service "," Giving them one even one star is too generous.  3 months on and I am still trying to make changes to my mortgage. Numerous calls made to their useless telephone help lines where you are kept holding for in excess of an hour only to be cut off and when you do finally speak to someone you are then faced with completely incompetent staff giving out incorrect information.  At their recommendation I was advised to have a phone appointment with a mortgage adviser.  After 2 hour long phone call to so called mortgage adviser I now find they have reneged on what was agreed on the phone. Disgraceful. After registering 3 separate complaints with them, still waiting for even one to be addressed correctly only to then receive some half hearted attempt at resolution where they think they can fob you off with a £100 compensation payment for the waste of your time, frustration and stress but still nothing satisfactory done with my original enquiry.   Fed up with their lame excuses, they make even the most simple request into a long drawn out battle. "

Customer_982, Pointless , Got married and changed my name and address in branch complete with all necessary documents and photocopies were taken by BANK_NAME. I lost my card 2 weeks later and ordered a replacement online only to receive an email telling me to ring customer services. BANK_NAME did not attempt to ring me and when I rang there was no option related to my query so had to faff around in an attempt to speak to a person instead of a machine. When I got through I was told I was not allowed to be issued another debit card unless I went to a branch with ID (the same ID they already had copies of). What's the point? I wanted to close my account but that would also require taking in some ID so I'm just going to leave it dormant. The only good aspect was the representative I spoke to was very polite and apologetic.

Then i had a mobile text from them saying my details had been changed on my account.. Which one, i have three and there was no phone no or contact details given. So i went into the local branch and there was nobody to speak to about it. So i lodged a complaint by email. I then had a complaint manager call and she refused to accept my concerns about contact options etc. There is no ordinary phone number issued for NW only a 0845 number and you need passwords etc to use that. SO i couldnt make phone contact . I found the whole saga a real pain and not what i call service at all. "

That explains why they use a central switchboard and the 50 questions robot, as not enough staff in branch to answer phones. However, cannot fault the friendly help provided and all ID documents were verified, scanned and promised to post off to the famous Ulster Bank who attract a lot of flak. They are a subsidiary of BANK_NAME, who also use the dreaded Digi docs system that can cause so much aggro. Thank you BANK_NAME for not insisting on a prior appointment and for hopefully putting the saver application with Ulster Bank back on track. "
Customer_995, Lack of business ethics. , Had to pay a mortgage fee to end mortgage agreement a year early due to divorce. Banked with BANK_NAME since 1986.

They seem to have swaped substance for marketing tat and have lost the very essence of great banking along the way.I can honestly say that whilst my business and personal life takes off, it has NOTHING to do with BANK_NAMEs help. They are very happy to hit me with unhelpful charges when the right thing would be to ask how they can help. They refused to open an account for a recent immigrant friend of mine who had good references, he was Romanian, and when a Canadian friend turned up in branch with the same credentials she got an account no problems at all. Go figure.Their technology is backward, the customer service gets worse and less capable every year.I really should find a better bank. "

Two weeks later I got a phone call from their solicitors asking why I hadnt sent back the documents they had sent me. It seems BANK_NAME couldn't be bothered letting their own solicitors know either . We quickly got approved by another provider and at the same rate.

My two new accounts have been created and appear on my online banking with zero balances but was not sure by who and when the first transfer will be done and online transfer facility not yet giving me the option  to transfer to the new accounts. Asked Call Centre for branch manager to ring me to tell me who was doing first tranfer but no response after three days. Popped into branch to leave note and bumped into manager who said it can take up to 15 days for call centre requests to be passed onto the branch but that the first transfer was probably"" being done by them but I still do not know when. Second switch does not come into effect until the end of the month so currently not an issue. Have told customer service I think their call centre/branch interfaces are not good but no reaction and I am still in the dark as to when my first switch is going to be made.Just checking my online statements every few days to see if the transfer has been made or not.

However the mortgage centre has repeatedly got the wrong information for me and is hopelessly bad at giving out information. I'm left now with a house going back on the market as I'm unable to provide the information needed to the agents ....all because no one has replaced the person who is off sick that I normally deal with.Also terrible service re using BANK_NAME to arrnage a full structural survey. 7 days after paying the full amount for this I am told they still don't know when it will be done and by who....... Totally useless for my situation. 
Customer_1013, Highly embarrassing. ," Having problems with credit card (that's another story) so arranged to pay for online groceries with BANK_NAME current account debit card. Went online to change payment details and followed their procedure which included taking a call on my landline to be given a code to use within 8 minutes. Late morning, about 3 hours before delivery due, the grocery store rang to say my payment had been declined so, as I have another account with a different bank, where, incidentally, I keep a much smaller balance, I made a payment from this account which went through with no problems. Later I rang BANK_NAME to see why the payment had been blocked and I spoke to a very abrupt female person who gave me no explanation as to why the payment was not accepted. She gave me some guff about how I wouldn't like it if my account was hacked and when I pointed out that the likelihood of a crim wanting to buy groceries to be delivered to my house and then standing by my house phone in order to answer it and take down the code to enable payment all without my knowledge was pretty slim to say the least. She replied 'You'd be surprised what they get up to'.Eventually, after a circular conversation lasting over ten minutes, I was no nearer to finding out why the payment had been blocked nor why I was not informed by BANK_NAME that it had been blocked. I was put through to the complaints department and I agreed to accept their offer of compensation and not to take any legal action. "

Customer_1017, Terrible Business Banking ," Honestly, you're better off looking elsewhere if you need a good business bank account. If you are a small business you'll get a pool of relationship managers that are next to useless. Why it isn't possible to have a named individual to help with your problems is anyone's guess. Any problems and you'll be given stock answers which the manager has to look up on the BANK_NAME website. "

Customer_1019, Horrible customer service ," Horrible online system; impenetrable, interminable, annoying phone system. They've got some pseudo modern systems but don't seem to realise how they're supposed to work. One example; you have to enter the card number when you dial in but when you finally reach an operator they ask for it again anyway. There are set security questions which can't be changed. So if you call to reset your password and the password is one of the security questions then you're stuck. "

Called again, found me on the system! Now we are just waiting for references, the account should be opened in 3-5 days, bulls**t, called again after 7 days, apparently they've sent some documents to sign, they didn't!

The first time was them charging me fees on several occasions but never going overdrawn and taking ages for them to accept the mistake and refund me.  The second time was blocking my card and online account due to a technical issue with the way the system that attempts to detect fraud.  When closing my account as a result of these problems I was told that you cannot close an account on weekends due their system not working on weekends.More recently after closing my account I thought I would use them to change back some foreign cash (as they had quite a good rate).  I spoke over the phone to them (which was a mission getting through to them) and confirmed that I could do this yesterday (Sat) and what the rate was.  On arrival at the bank I queued for 15minutes only to be told their system doesnt allow foreign currency transactions on weekends.They seriously need to sort themselves out.  The grass is definitely greener if you change bank.  Very happy with Co-operative at the moment. "

I hadn't been to my branch (Chatham) for some time until yesterday. The premises are shabby, dull and not too clean. The staff look generally untidy. I was withdrawing a fairly large amount of cash and asked if this could be carried out in a private room away from the counter. I was told this would not be possible. You need to buck your ideas up BANK_NAME. "
Customer_1027, Refusal because of their mistakes!! ," I am suppose to move on Saturday 30th of June, I was unable to pay the deposit for the house last Saturday 23.06.12 to be ready for this week due to the problems that BANK_NAME had been experiencing fair enough""  so I phoned the on line banking service to be told I had to go to the nearest bank and request a bankers draft"
Customer_1028, BANK_NAME closes my account without reason. ," I am very disappointed in this bank. I opened this bank because I genuinely thought that this bank would give me the best service and the best banking facility possible. But after opening this account I have used it normally and nothing was really wrong with this account. But after 3 months of opening my account BANK_NAME has decided to close my account without giving any reason or explanation. This has left me very confused as I am looking through my statement since first opening the account to check if anything was wrong with the account and even double checking and I have to agree that 100% there is nothing wrong with the account. The account is what you would expect any normal human being would use it but for some reason that they would not reveal to me they decide to close my account and that leaves me clueless to why they would do this. Every time I call I get transferred over to the accunt closure team and they won't give me any reason to why my account is being closed and the only thing that I can do is file a complaint to think"" why my account was closed and prove to them it was wrong for them to close my account. This bank has really angered me because them giving me the reason to why my bank getting closed would lead to a more successful investigation but they would like to keep that information to themselves and close the account. This service is absolutely horrendous and my account was what you would expect a close to perfect account would be. Now I have to other banking arrangements because BANK_NAME has decided to close my account for no reason. To be honest at least another bank would treat me and make me feel welcome to bank with them unlike BANK_NAME who doesn't give notice that they would be closing your account until you have to find out by yourself when you log onto online banking and phone them which is very terrible service. I hope anyone reading this to not even attempt to open a bank account with BANK_NAME because you would end up like me and having your bank account closed for having a normal bank account. This bank is absolutely terrible. """
Customer_1029, I wish I could put zero stars!!!! ," I applied and got approved for a loan from another company (not BANK_NAME) and paid to have the money paid into my account same day as I had some loans I wanted to consolidate. Within half an hour of receiving payment, BANK_NAME have locked my account and blocked my card! After calling the fraud team number, going though security, explaining the situation and being told my accounts have been unblocked, I go to make a payment ... declined! I use online chat, waste of time, not even an English person responding and Sanket couldn't tell me anything about my account. They give me a number to call. I speak to someone who tells me the blocks haven't been removed so he has to forward me to the fraud team (AGAIN!). Go through security for 4th time! Told he's lifted the blocks on my accounts. I tell him to double check, he comes back, 'oh no sorry there is another layer to this, I will have to forward you to a specialist team but the problem is, if the call is not answered within 30-60 seconds, a call back will be issued and phone put down' Needless to say this happened! I have been told to expect a 3-4 hour wait before anyone calls me back (almost 90 minutes so far) all the while I have no access to the funds that I have signed papers for and paid money for same day access. I'm absolutely fuming!! Surely they can see where the money has originated from!I have banked with BANK_NAME for almost 10 years and their lack of live updating on the accounts, the nightmare of trying to get through to any advisors and waiting for call backs plus the non English agents on live chat makes me wonder why I'm still with them! I was going to open my business account with them but I think I take a wide birth! I'm not even sure I will keep the three accounts I already have! I'm sat here waiting for a call back with no control over any of my money, all the while the bills I so desperately need to pay cant get paid and I have no access to funds to buy food and petrol for my family. Best of all they have had chance to remove the apparent 'fraudulent' account from my online banking but no chance to call me back and explain to me what the hell is going on!! I appreciate they take fraud very seriously and I understand that but I have gone through security 4 times this evening proving I am who I say I am but that's not good enough! What's the point of having these security pins and passwords if it doesn't prove who I am! Rubbish rubbish bank! "
Customer_1030, Very unprofessional , I applied for a current account online and when I received letter from the bank i went to the nearest branch with my documents to open my account they lady was so rude and said u can not open account unless u switch ur pervious account with us i will never open my account with unprofessional people then i left my number for call back with contacting me they send a txt that we tried to contact you but u were not available lol i will never recommend BANK_NAME to any1 
Customer_1031, Disgusting Treatment !!!!!!!!!! ," I applied for a extension of my overdraft today, which I have never asked the bank for anything before. This was my only option as my dad was supporting me until my first ever full time wage came in on the 30th of April, but he has passed away within the last week. I explained all of this to the bank and they still wouldn't take this into consideration and kept passing me department to department with no consideration what so ever.  They declined my overdraft extension but accepted my friends who is on benefits...... JOKE. I will be shutting my bank account as soon as possible to get out of there disgusting treatment !!!!!!!!!! "
Customer_1032, Crap ," I applied for a new account with BANK_NAME as I was having bad service with BANK_NAME..... But my service with BANK_NAME was ridiculous...... I went to one of the local branches in Tenby, they said we dont open accounts here. So I was in Milford Haven one day and went in there.... I was told to come back at 3:30 so I did... They where very punctual and helpful. They opened me an advantage gold account, with Visa Debit..cheque book.... They also said I could have a £7,000! Overdraft limit, I declined and said £250 would do. I got my card, pin and cheque book through and went to pay my mortgage with my card as I hadn't been able to set up a new Direct Debit in time..... They said my card had been declined and to contact my bank. I went to Cardigan branch my closest who said my account had been closed.... I asked why, no explination.... So i asked where my money was, he said im not sure..... I then had to go to Halifax and withdraw my savings to pay my mortgage...... Me, my partner, brother, sisters and nan have now all moved to Halifax and its going well. They offered me a sensable overdraft and never had any problems "
Customer_1033, Fake offer for credit card with zero interest in customer service ," I applied for a reward credit card online and was offered £20,000 which I accepted knowing full well I could reduce this amount to a responsible level for me afterwards. The card and the pin came through ready for me to activate the card, when I got a telephone call at work. It wasn't convenient at the time  to talk, so the gentlemen sent me a text to say, the credit card has been accepted with a £2500 limit and that paperwork will show the incorrect limit of £20,000. Their texting was one way and I couldn't reply back either through text or voice call. They might have a customer service somewhere but it seems invisible hiding somewhere and even when you log in online to your current account it is difficult to find any contact for customer service. Obviously, Customer service is not priority for this bank.There is obviously a online credit check in place when you apply for these things and when the bank goes back on what it has offered you, makes the whole exercise pointless and not worth applying for. I wrote to them to cancel my credit card which they did, and in the process they'll probably taint the credit history as well. So Beware before you apply. Never trust a bank who doesn't trust itself with zero customer service. "
Customer_1034, Stay away! After 3 weeks and wasting hours on the phone I gave up! ," I applied for a start-up business bank account. After filling up a form online, and spending an hour on the phone being interviewed I thought I'm almost there. That was 3 weeks ago. What followed was a lot of nonsense emails from the business manager with confusing instructions, one sent me to the local branch to submit my ID. The local branch couldn't make heads or tails of her instructions and couldn't understand where they should send my ID copy, wasting another hour and causing a lot of stress. Once that was finally done, the business manager blamed me for the confusion and said she'll contact me once she receives my ID verification. She never did get back to me and when I emailed her a week later to see what's going on, she said she's waiting for documents from me! Apparently she has sent an application pack I need to fill in and return to her by post (I never received it), without even notifying me by email. She then sent me the PDF pack by email to print off and send to her. When I returned her email the same day, I got an automated reply saying she's on holiday now for 2 weeks! I rang the helpline to understand who I should be sending my business application to now and they gave me an address. I've sent the pack a week ago and it's been dead silence since then. I've just rung up the helpline again and the chap could not find any of my details online nor could he contact the business team. At this point I'm giving up. If only I had checked BANK_NAME reviews online before starting this whole mess I wouldn't have wasted so much time and phone hours. Stay away from them if you're smart! "
Customer_1035, Would give zero stars if i could , I applied for an account (Select silver) Have received my card and pin and online banking details. Even signed up for the benefits. Then get a letter saying my application was unsuccessful? Er why? No explanation just my accounts are now off my banking screen. What a waste of money if they do that to all customers who are unsuccessful ! 
Customer_1036, horrible customer service , I asked for a confirmation of past addresses letter. They said basically that they can't help.Ive banked with other banks who provided such a letter with no hassle.Very disappointed. 
Customer_1037, Worst service ever I have had , I asked for a loan was accepted as I filled in all the information and was great didn't hear anything so I phone three days later and they said we have been sending text today we wanted more information fine sent that in but not heard anything so called them and and they wanted more information sent that in but they said that they hadn't received it so I contacted them again and was told to go in to my local branch to fax it over and I get a rude lady in branch told me I had to go to a office supplier to fax it there fax was for there use and they call there self helpful banking BANK_NAME is misleading there customers as they are not helpful stay well clear I don't see how they are going as they don't seem to wont to lend to there customers I have been with BANK_NAME and rbs for 11 years and I am looking for a new bank as they have poor service and poor customer service you complain but you don't get anywhere with them 
Customer_1038, Appalling , I banked with BANK_NAME for 12 years. I received advice from them that the funds within one of my accounts was safe. Then against their own advice they closed this account and I was denied access from the funds. Knowing my money is no longer safe with them I have now left the bank. 
Customer_1039, Don't bank! ," I believe that customer's are just a nuisance to them, they don't listen, they pre-judge and consider service to be a thing of the past "
Customer_1040, TIME TO MOVE , I bread going into my London Branch ...However CHELTENHAM BRANCHES are amazing ..Either i find a new bank OR i move ... 
Customer_1041," Be warned, they'll suddenly block your current account and refuse to tell you why! "," I called BANK_NAME this morning and they refused to make a payment for me, blocked my current account and access to online banking for no good reason - despite me passing all their security requirements, and more. The payment was for a low amount and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary for me. This bank is going down the drain! AWFUL customer service. AVOID AVOID AVOID  #unhelpfulbanking "
Customer_1042, TERRIBLE SERVICE ," I called BANK_NAME to ask if it is possible to provide them my new address on the phone and get reminder of my pin/password. It took 40 min until the customer assistant told me that incredibly it is not possible and you need to write in the bank"" That answer could be provided to me directly the first minute and not after 40 min. The customer assistant was telling me ""bear me few moments to ask my colleagues to advice me"" again and again  wishing to keep me in the line and pay (calling from another country). Then I asked the most common question ""what is the interest rate for a saving account"". The assistant again had to search"
Customer_1043, Not helpful at all!! ," I called the help line to help me and they couldn't! I only wanted to transfer money and they can't! I can only go to the bank, what is the point of having a 24 hour help service if they cannot help!!!! Rubbish! Wish I'd never banked with them! "
Customer_1044, Shambles ," I can only imagine that anyone who gave BANK_NAME 3 or more stars either has zero interaction with them or has left the cap off the glue.  It seems that BANK_NAME personal and business accounting are going through slow divorce where the customers are the kids left to pick up the pieces.  We are told the business children are moving to a new home with Williams and Glyn.  Whilst this never actually seems to happen, the existing services from BANK_NAME seem to have stopped getting any sort of maintenance a couple of years ago.  The main app will work with personal accounts and an older business account but doesnt want to know a new business account, even though it seems to be the same product.  Similarly a new business account wont work with the card reader of an existing business account (requiring its own special card, rather than existing debit cards as used by the other accounts) and whilst payment contacts used to be shared between existing personal and business accounts on the main app, they aren't on online banking between any of the accounts, or with the dedicated business app.  The business app is supposed to support multiple business accounts, unless that is, they are already accessed by the main app.  I was told that 'Bankline Lite' would answer all my prayers of being able to access all my accounts, business and personal, from a single point, for a modest fee (nothing in print, call to haggle).  I called to set this up, but was cut off whilst being transferred following 38 minutes of an electronic rendition of Greensleeves.  Add to this that the business credit card services are included on neither app (Even though the personal one is fine.  I never got as far as finding out if Bankline covered this), and is accessed through 'Card Services' (think Teletext, interesting if you want to show your kids what the very first websites looked like), and it makes for a pretty dysfunctional family.  I'd love to say there were some redeeming features . . . . . . . . at least the staff are always nice.  If only the management were as competent as the call handlers are polite. "
Customer_1045, Please save sanity and avoid ," I can see what BANK_NAME don't encourage customers to go to Trust Pilot! No issue with staff, but automated systems are appalling. Online banking unreliable and i beg you never to bother with webchat. All they can do is cut and paste numbers you have never managed to get through to and ignore any questions. Been customer for 10 years and enough is enough. "
Customer_1046, Been with them for 10 years.. , I can't belive the ridiculous fees they charge you even if it's not ur fault..plus they have closed my local bank which was 10 minutes drive now I have to drive 30 minutes to get to the other branch which is ridiculous.. 
Customer_1047, I love BANK_NAME ," I changed my bank account to BANK_NAME 9 years ago and never regretted it. They were brilliant when I was a student in terms no interest overdraft, etc. If I've ever had any problems, they have always sorted it out straight away. Every branch I've been to the staff are really helpful and understanding although the local branch I regularly use are the best. BANK_NAME offers a lots of bonuses such as there online banking is really safe and secure and I absolutely love their cashback plus scheme as I've made 5 pounds in just over a month!!! Recently, when I've been in to have my account reviewed rather trying to offer me lots of potential debt, they instead looks at budgeting and perks such as their cbp scheme. Before BANK_NAME, I had three different banks where there were awfully rude and unhelpful staff and was not worth it. I really do love BANK_NAME and would encourage anyone to bank with them. "
Customer_1048," Ground hog day mortgage service, no continuity, ill informed staff and poor advice. "," I currently have a mortgage with BANK_NAME and my wife's business account is also with BANK_NAME. Im moving home so decided to go to  BANK_NAME for a quote and tried to save time with my application by using the online route, big mistake...They are awful at promptly getting in touch when information is required and tend to mix their channels, I feel like I always need to chase them, applications stagnate, underwriters with limited knowledge of accounting cause road blocks with no solutions  and the front line staff aren't equipped to help. The advisor was great but couldn't help much afterwards. Also good luck trying to fax your details from a understaffed branch.  Go with BANK_NAME and their 'dropped balls' could put an end to your purchase, like a slow car crash . Save time and money, look elsewhere.Martyn "
Customer_1049, terrible customer service , I decided to close my accounts as BANK_NAME after constantly being harassed about having review meetings/ opening an ISA etc etc each time i went into the branch to make a deposit. Went into the branch and was told i would have to make an appointment to close my account. Could not get an appointment for another 2 weeks as I HAVE A JOB MONDAY-FRIDAY!!!!After waiting 2 weeks i arrived to my appointment 5 minutes early and was asked to wait in the seating area. 20 minutes later i was still sat waiting. i went to a member of staff who was constantly asking others if she could help them. I pointed out i was still waiting for my appointment to which she replied - yes we are running late aren't we. you will have to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting I was finally called by my customer adviser who muttered something of an apology under his breath. Bad enough i had to wait 2 weeks for an appointment but then sat in the branch for 30 mins with barely anyone noticing. If things are running late people could at least let customers know when they arrive an give some indication of how long they will be waiting. An actual apology after 30 minutes of waiting would also be appreciated. 
Customer_1050, Useless - can't even open an account ," I decided to open accounts for my children and applied online as making branch appointments with three children in tow is not ideal. Filled out the forms, printed out, signed and sent off the appropriate proofs of id and address. Few days later the id is returned. Few days later new letters arrive asking for id so I phone customer services. We discover the applications have been muddled and all Id has ended up on one account- easy to fix and they'll sort it and phone me back. Week later, no more letters so I phone again and no, still not sorted. Explain whole thing again, promised same solution and a phone call to confirm. You guessed it, no call came.  A week later I decided to phone again, same story, and then again today. Seriously, if they can't even open an account they do not deserve my money! "
Customer_1051, SO HELPFUL ," I don't belong to this bank, but when my Father died I had to go into the Plymouth branch in Old Town Street and met a lovely man called Edwardwho was so,so, helpful in closing down my Fathers account . He is a real asset to them. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. "
Customer_1052," poor interest rates, poor service "," I don't know why I am still bsnmking with them. I guess all banmks are the same.First of all, their interest rates are poor.Secondly, every time I ask to change notes into smaller change, they ask me for my business name, but I don't have a business. I'm then told that I need to pay for change if I have a business. Can't a normal person get some change for the vending machine or car parking?Every time that I try to use my debit card to pay for something online, it fails. So if you're a heavy online shopper, remember to use a card from a different bank.This has not happened to me,but my mum and my brother has tried their paying in machine, which was supervised by one of their employees, and the money was not paid into their accounts. That is more like a money I scamming machine, so stay away from that.Also, my mum went in to get some changes, and 50p was missing from the bag of coins, so remember to check your change before you leave the bank. Either their weighing scales don't work or they just can't be bothered. "
Customer_1053, I don't use BANK_NAME for all my … ," I don't use BANK_NAME for all my financial products, but have been pretty happy with them generally.  I find the local branches particularly helpful - Dronfield and Bakewell are well worth a mention - friendly, helpful and professional.  The larger Chesterfield one is rather disorganised and difficult to work out where you're supposed to go (different sections, none of which have signs - it can be a guessing game!) but when you do eventually see someone they're usually helpful. "
Customer_1054, WAR IS HELL!!! ," I don't want to deal with BANK_NAME, I really don't, I only do so when I have no choice as dealing with them is always hell, it's always a fight to get something simple done. I tried to purchase an item online but they stopped the purchase and put me through the most draconian, insane, utterly paranoid, and extreme security procedures just to release the payment I was trying to make from a company I'd purchased from numerous times before. It took three operators and three security grillings like something out of the Official Gestapo Interrogation Handbook before they'd finally let me pay. ONE HOUR, IT TOOK ONE HOUR to make a transaction that should have taken seconds. ONE HOUR dealing with idiots at BANK_NAME which cost me time, money, and stress. They even told me to call back later so I could make my purchase at their convenience! Yes you read that correctly! Who the hell do they think they are??? One hour to do something that should take seconds, this is BANK_NAME 'efficiency' for you. The full story is a horror story. Time to move banks, these lot are just too much to deal with.Dealing with BANK_NAME is ALWAYS a war, they make life as difficult as possible and think they're doing you a favour.Is this extreme behaviour really fraud protection or is it secret capital controls? I do wonder. "
Customer_1055, Stealing buggers ," I had a balance of £92 Monday night, Tuesday morning £34 was paid into my account yet my balance stayed exactly the same, contacted BANK_NAME to be told they're system was right therefore I'm wrong, unless I dreamt going to asda last night and checking my balance at the cashpoint or the cashpoint lied to me but it's definitely not BANK_NAME to blame. Oh wait when I contacted BANK_NAME they confirmed I was in asda so it must be the cashpoint fibbing to people because all cashpoints have the ability to give false bank balances, I think the chip on the card is there for decor "
Customer_1056, fine until you need anything ," i had a bank account happily with BANK_NAME for years without any problems. that was until i needed something more than then to take my money and hold on to it.I went in to see the team at my local branch (bury) about getting a mortgage and was told there would be no problems and to proceed and put an offer in on the house i had spoken with them about.upon this offer being accepted i went in for the in depth mortgage application, only to be told they could not offer me this amount as they didn't calculate it properly when they told me it would be ok.i then resultantly changed bank and applied for a mortgage with another bank.as part of this application i needed to show bank statements for my BANK_NAME account (now closed) to prove all my spending and income matched up.i have informed the bank i need these statements as i am being chased by the seller yet this seems to make no difference to them.it is now approaching 2 months since first applying for this statement, at least 6 phone calls and repeat applications to various members of the BANK_NAME team (including managerial staff) and i am still yet to receive these.This matter is still on going and could actually result in the loss of my house due to the incompetence and total lack of customer service from the staff at BANK_NAME.i will up date this as and when the problem is resolved. "
Customer_1057, Excellent Customer Service ," I had a fraud done in my account, a company was taking money out without me knowing.  So I called up BANK_NAME and they immediately helped me out and have promised to get my money refunded. Not only that, but the staff are kind as well as polite. Hats Off :D "
Customer_1058, Awful horrendous , I had a fraud reversal come out of the wrong account without telling me. Left me in trouble when I asked for cash back they put me through to 16 people none helped. I'm fuming. Do not use BANK_NAME ever. I know it's a last v result for poor credit but don't bother. They are crap. Person called GUY and Chris Barnes and Sharon and rashid bloody useless. 
Customer_1059, Superb customer service from Canton Branch Cardiff , I had a problem where money had gone into the wrong account. I thought it would be a simple matter to rectify. It wasnt
Customer_1060, Antonia is a star ," I had a problem with my card being swallowed by a cash machine, and Antonia (I could have misheard the name, she was a lovely Scottish lady if that helps!!) was an absolute star sorting out the cancellation of my card, helping me out with a code to withdraw money from a cash machine and assuring me that a replacement card would be sent to me shortly. I hope this review finds its way to Antonia directly because she was absolutely amazing and deserves to know that I'd be in pieces without her!!!! "
Customer_1061, Inconsistant ," I had a standing order set up to go from BANK_NAME to a Halifax Help to Buy ISA account and wanted to change the payment amount for two months whilst I saved to go on holiday. I did it in good time, in branch and got a receipt. When I checked my account on the date it was supposed to go out the full amount had been taken so I went into the branch and they let me use their phone to call the customer complaints team. I got through straight away, the man was very helpful and replaced the money at considerable cost to the bank. The whole thing was sorted out within less than an hour and I was assured it wouldn't happen again. A month later, whilst on holiday I realised it had happened again. When I got back I called the customer complaints team and they said they'd call me back within 24 hours. I have now called the customer complaints team a total of ten times, waiting up to twenty minutes on hold each time and always being 'guarenteed' they would get back to me within 24 hours as this was a 'serious matter to them'. I have not been contacted a single time. I finally went back into the branch and spoke to the manager who was incredibly helpful and emailed the customer complaints team himself. If it wasn't for him I would have given up and switched banks. I finally got my money back whilst they investigate what went wrong but no one told me they were doing that leaving me up at night stressing they'd taken the money out of my Halifax ISA and I would no longer be able to buy a house. No one could tell me what was going on, just that the complaint was open but no one had been allocated to it. Yet someone was able to go into my account and make payments without contacting me first? The whole thing has taken me over a week and would have taken me a lot longer if the branch manager hadn't helped me out. I just hope I never have to go through complaints again! A lot of hassle, explaining the situation over and over and that's only if you get through to them. "
Customer_1062, They said it would save money - it saved them money but cost me ," I had an accident with their insurer and BANK_NAME contacted me - they assured me that I could claim for all my uninsured losses and although it saved them money for me to go through them, their inefficiencies cost me money in time and effort.Go through your own insurers, let them through the nose. "
Customer_1063, How to retaliate effectively with this mortgage provider ," I had an interest  mortgage with them and asked for an extension to the term of the mortgage. When I explained that we had numerous other properties which were mortgage free they said that they would not take this into account even if the value of of these properties were 1 BILLION POUNDS.I paid the mortgage off. Sent them a cheque for odd amounts like £199.89 and such like every working day for over 2 years. Each one needed to be  acknowledged, the mortgage recalculated with interest credits calculated and ledgered, and the standing order changed. You do not have to be bullied by the Banks. If you have a mortgage with this Bank and are having ANY difficulty with them  do the same and snow them under with administrative work. Send the first few cheques off without a stamp and they will soon send you a supply of prepaid envelopes! "
Customer_1064, How helpful are they? ," I had an BANK_NAME Account for 6 days and closed it, the safe in a few branches I find not welcoming and look bored of there jobs. There Parent company RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland) is 80% owned by Tax pay, but wonder how they can afford to show adverts, I am sure Tax Payers should attend CEO meetings about the bank  and not MP's. Still makes you wonder how BANK_NAME can charge customers overdrafts when they have already paid it in Tax.There getting money from Tax payers twice over and when you pay tax on your current account it's most likely heading back into the RBS group.A family member who is in another bank or building society took some money out of a BANK_NAME account but did not give them the money so got worried and asked to use BANK_NAME phones to contact there Bank or Building Society due to them being worried and BANK_NAME Staff where leaning over and asking them to hurry up. Seems it's okay for them to put money back in next day put not happy to re-assure a member of the public and they were also rudely spoken too. "
Customer_1065, Nothing they can do to help! ," I had fraudulent activity on my account which left my on hold for around 3 hours to BANK_NAME by which time they told me that my money is now lost and there is nothing they can do.After complaining that an activation code and a phone number seems to be far too little to create a mobile banking app and start taking money out of my account the same day, they told me they cannot change this and it is out of their hands... They create the App and the restrictions and rules on how it is used. They are the only people in a position to change it. They were unhelpful, unsympathetic rude and patronising and made it out that I was being unreasonable! "
Customer_1066, I had no issues with this bank at all … ," I had no issues with this bank at all for the past 6-7 years to find yesterday after issues with my card from Friday 28th which was my payday so of course had payments due, I find out they have closed my account.apparently I breached one of their terms and conditions under act 7.1 which there are 4 random reason as to why they can close my account.When reporting the card issue on friday i was not advised and the helpful adviser in the branch re-ordered a new card. Wednesday 3rd April i woke up to more declined emails, no access to my online banking, several conversations with people, visit to the actual bank, where they were completely helpful but said that they didn't understand what was going on - in the end the i was informed my money was put on hold under review, when i asked why and said i needed it (this was with someone over the phone, closed accounts) they put me on hold for 2 mins, then advise they could give me my money into the branch's account - i was given pretty much my full wages in cash and now have no bank account and no answers. this is unacceptable and has put a lot of stress on my life, dealing with late payments fees, days off work to visit banks to get an new account and just generally an uneeded headache. the staff at Richmond Branch were very helpful, thanks to them I was able to get something back.

Customer_1067, Offshore account is a nightmare ," I had the so called Offshore"" account or ""international"""
Customer_1068, Beware! cashiers steal your money! worst customer service. ," i have a business account with BANK_NAME for around ten years now, and this bank is going from bad to worse.on my way out of the country i stopped at the local branch to personally make a payment into my account of £3983.22  and i got a stamped receipt.a few days later got an “automated” credit amendment letter saying that due to wrong amount of cheques the total is only £1983.22. i called in on the day to inquire and complained, 1. i counted the money before coming to the bank, and the cashier counted the money and as i mentioned i have the stamped receipt, so this is impossible! - this is not a £10 difference!2. how can they simple debit my account without my agreement when i have a stamped receipt of £3983.22? isn't this day light legitimate theft?3. how can they get away with just sending an automated latter with an amendment of £2000 less without calling me or at least sending a letter with a bit more detail?they told me they will investigate and promised to call back.no one did!so i called again and was promised a call back again, but... no call back!and so i called many times and was constantly promised a call back but no one ever called!!!after a few weeks i got a letter (seems like no one had the guts to speak to me directly) from them firstly apologizing, then asking me to go back to the people who gave me the cheques for replacements, then stressing that the letter is a generic letter they send to all customers with such issues.i wrote back to them as follows:With regards to the missing cheques, I am sorry to inform you that I have no record of the cheques and they were from (which is the normal scenario by me and by most people indeed!), but what upsets me is your behavior again! – why are you the man on top instructing me what to do as if I did something wrong?- I should be instructing you what to do in this case!!! This is the same behavior as the generic letter you sent, as if you don’t owe me anything and I owe you he world,!Can I send you a letter out of my system without even a sorry saying: I would like to inform, you that the credit to my account of £2000 is a mistake and should be £20.000 and debit the bank? Who do you think you are – because the money is sitting by you?You then move on to “confirm” that the generic letter is something you sent to all customers… does this in any way resolve my issue or does it actually make the point stronger? – why do you think that because you are called BANK_NAME you can treat customers like this? Would any of your creditors dare to write a generic letter to you without any sorry or prior discussion that the 50 million you deposited only came up to 40 million in a generic letter? And if they would, they would be sued in court immediately! Never mind if they actually debited your account…With regards to your customer service, I have had plenty of sorry’s over the past 10 years I have been with you and I can confirm that you take customer service extremely lightly and nothing at all is being done to fix this, in fact it’s going from bad to worse, and I want you to be clear that moving forward with this claim I will demand answers for every person I spoke to (which I have recorded) why they didn’t call back as promised.And you cannot agree that the bank made an error with the letter…..?!To summarise; -	The money in question should firstly be credited to my account immediately and unconditionally, and in future to never be debited before agreeing with customer.-	I want clear answers from each person I spoke to why they didn’t call back.-	Generic letters should be totally abolished (unless the sum in question is less then £20), and in future you should behave like you expect anyone to behave to you, so either call them to discuss or write a letter inquiring if the customer can maybe help and give you some info etc-	To reintroduce a personal business manager who will deal with “all” my issues, and one that would stay for at least 5 years (at least not 5 weeks as till now!), because I am sick and tired of going round in circles and being transferred from one to another.-	I will be pressing for minimum £650 compensation which includes losses of business due to £2000 debited.To date - 2 months on-  i have not had a response from them!!!

Customer_1069, Honest Review of BANK_NAME ," I have a current account, joint account, ISA and credit card with BANK_NAME. I have been banking with BANK_NAME since my parents opened a basic account for my pocket money when i was 8. I am now 23. Had many ups and downs with BANK_NAME but thats both parties faults. These include being accidentally charged for being overdrawn when i wasnt that happened a couple of times but was rectified quickly and removed from my credit record. I was unfortunately the subject of fraud on my current account and i must say that the way that was handled was a bit slow - all my wages were taken the day i was paid so numerous charges were added when payments bounced but they managed to claw the money back and give me some compensation. My ISA has always been straightforward. I have had a credit card with them since i was 20 and they recently offered me and increased limit. They wrote to me with the offer, called me to see if i had any questions, the letter told me what to do if i didnt want the limit increased and how to accept it you called an automated service clicked a few options and voila updated limit in 24hrs. The only negative aspect of banking is your balance doesnt update over the weekend and i have found that sometimes transactions can take up to a month to appear or even be taken but it must be known the bank will only release funds once requested from the merchant - people moan about that all the time but its not always the banks fault. Hoping to get a mortgage with BANK_NAME also in the near future! Thanks BANK_NAME. "
Customer_1070, Awful ," I have a had business account for 4 years. This account has a £80,000 a year credit turnover. They Refused  to accept a a credit of £2900 cash over the counter for no other reason than they couldn't be bothered. Customer service is non existent. Fees are high compared to alternatives. You really are paying for sod all. "
Customer_1071, Take all the money from you they can - Be careful - Non-existant Customer Service ," I have a pending complaint with BANK_NAME. BANK_NAME does not have any facility to help customers when they themselves benefit from not helping. They have basically taken 500 GBP from me over the past 10 months. BE CAREFUL, READ THE SMALLPRINT, READ YOUR T&Cs in great detail and even then some things don't make sense. THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE "
Customer_1072, Worst banking service ," I have applied a Business Bank Account with BANK_NAME and it's over a month now, there is no progress.  For last one week i have been calling them for the account number and I get only one response Its almost done and will have the account number in 2 hrs"" but this has been the case from last one week. The worst customer service from this bank. I would like to give 0 start but do not have negative marking. """
Customer_1073, I have banked with BANK_NAME all my life and I am leaving , I have banked with BANK_NAME all my life and am moving backs because they just don't care about their customers.  They closed the branch in our town and said it was OK because  the one in the next town 4 miles away would pick up the slack.  One year later they closed that one.We now have a 40 minute round trip to get to a bank and have to pay to park. 
Customer_1074, I have banked with BANK_NAME for 15-17 … ," I have banked with BANK_NAME for 15-17 years and up until now I have not had a problem, but 2 weeks ago I was a victim of fraud through my mobile banking app, I immediately went to the bank ( as I couldn't get through on the phone, continually busy ) I had to wait approx 10 mins to see a member of staff, they at first said my account was fine but when I checked my account I had been mostly cleared out, now they are refusing to refund any money as they said I had given out my personal details and pin, I appealed against this so now they have said it's now down to smartphone and software the fraudsters are using ( even though it's their app they got into ) but still not refunding any money. I'm continuing to fight this I'm not rich ( but the rich would get their money back ) I'm a normal working foster carer and carer for my disabled husband and the money which was taken was partly carers money. I'm now looking to switching to a bank with better security as that what banks are supposed to do be, financially secure. They are blaming anything and everything else not to repay the money taken from my account, when its their banking app which the fraudsters got into. DONT BANK WITH BANK_NAME PLEASE its made me physically sick and feel violated that someone has done this and I cant get any help from what should be a trusted institution "
Customer_1075, Disgraceful response to complaint , I have banked with BANK_NAME for over 30 years.I have been locked out of online and telephone banking for over 1 week and so am unable to transfer money to pay a BANK_NAME credit card bill that is due. I tried to complete the online complaint form but one of the drop down boxes has no options and it is not possible to submit the complaint without completing it. I copied the complaint and sent it to someone (Peniel) in their Online Chat Complaint team who could not resolve the problem and would not give me a reference number  for a logged complaint. I don't think they are even going to respond to the complaint but will still charge me for late payment of the credit card bill.Staggeringly poor. 
Customer_1076, Poor processes and customer service ," I have banked with BANK_NAME for years out of habit without realising there were much better banks out there. Only recently I opened an account with another bank offering a higher interest and realised what an appalling service I received for years. I assumed banking was a painful experience because that's how it has been with them. Some of the issues I have had: cancel my cards despite notifying them of my intention to travel internationally which could have left me in a terrible position if I weren't with friends, failed to provide a replacement card before the old one expired so I was locked out of my accounts, even the online as I needed the card for the reader so when I needed to make a transfer I had to go to the bank and was told a transfer to another bank had a fee of £20!! I took the money out in cash and walked to the other bank to deposit it...waste of my time!Since the last 4 weeks I have been trying to close my accounts and the process is equally slow and convoluted. their phone/online is limited so again I was forced to go to the branch, terrible service and they blatantly lied saying the process would take 3 working days....it has been 15 I am still waiting! "
Customer_1077, BE WARNED DO NOT BANK WITH BANK_NAME , I have banked with them for 10 years then out of the blue they just close my account with out any warning. So I but a complaint in and was told someone would get back to me within 5 days.and I would receive a letter in that time guess what never did. After 3 weeks they just open it again.  I call them every day and all I got out of them sorry we do not know why. It is being dealt with by another department. Which you can not talk to.it was a nightmare then they send you letters to say your dd were not paid what a joke when they shut it down. Once it was opened after 3 weeks and still no reply. Then 2 weeks after I get a letter to say they are closing my account in 60 days   and  they still have not told me why.  Just says on letter we have the right not do say why  plus they done the same to my business account. Make your own mind up. Just goggle  it and see how many more people have had the same. Customer service is a waste of time  .there not worried about customers just them self.  And no I did not have any over draft or any loans with them did not owe them any money.just be careful if i was you look at other banks . 
Customer_1078," Thieves, thieves and thieves. "," I have been a client of BANK_NAME bank for the last 8 years, I have been using my account regularly despite living abroad (I live in the UAE), to my surprise, my card was blocked on July 5th, when I called to enquire what was the issue, they informed me that my account had been closed, and supposedly they sent me a letter 60 days before to inform me of the decision (a letter which was never received).There was no reasons given to me as to why the bank has taken such decision, the Customer Service people on the line told me that “we are no obliged to provide a reason for closing an account, the initial application terms and conditions (small print) mentions that the bank has the freedom to close any account at any point in time…” and they call themselves a bank.My issues do not end there, as I have referred to their “Exit Team” for the transfer of the outstanding funds, they requested that I provide them with copy of my passport + utility bill certified by an accountant, lawyer or notary, which usually costs between 35 to 50 gbp. A cost I was not willing to pay, I had the document certified at the embassy showing it is a true copy, despite that, they refused the document under the reason that “it must be an accountant, lawyer or notary who certifies the document.”After few exchanges, I realized that they are making it impossible to recover the fund, I simply gave up on them, and really hope, they will incur as much loss and prejudice as we did.Will never go back to this bank and would not recommend it to anyone.I am giving 1 star as it is not possible to give them minus. "
Customer_1079, Mediocre at best ," I have been a customer of BANK_NAME for many years.  Until recently I couldn't really complain about them but then again that's because I have never really needed to contact Customer Services for anything significant.  I have an Advantage Gold account with them, and this month they have decided to increase the monthly fee by 16% from £12.95 to £15 whilst taking away some of their best benefits.  They had Identity Theft Protection which I used some of the prevention services of regularly.  They have taken that away and replaced it with 2 family day passes a year at National Trust.  Great, at a time when Identity Theft is at its highest they're handing us leisure vouchers instead of trying to protect their customers.  They have also taken away other insurances.  I spoke to Customer Services and they said it was a business decision"".  I have a First Class business degree"
Customer_1080, Loyal customer leaving for NationWide ," I have been a loyal customer for 5 years. I have a personal account, joint account, savings account and a credit card was also looking for a mortgage with them but over the last year customer service/value has been very poor considering there is huge competition in the banking sector you would think they would would be fighting to hang on to customers? Maybe they are to big to care about us mere mortals!! I withdrew £900 from Seven Oaks BANK_NAME branch off my credit card and it took 1 month to show when I complained I was told it can take up to 6 months read the small print this affected my credit score so be carful . I went £2 over my limit!!!! "
Customer_1081, I have been a BANK_NAME customer since … , I have been a BANK_NAME customer since 1974 and I have the 'Private Account'.Over the past few months I have needed to speak to someone from customer services during the evening and have sometimes waited 20 minutes then given up.I can only think they have reduced the number of staff which is very irritating when I pay a premium for this account. Sort yourself out  BANK_NAME 
Customer_1082, Good resolution ," I have been a BANK_NAME account holder since I was a child. I recently applied to open a joint account with my partner, and there was some friction due to lack of information provided when setting this account up online as my other half doesn't bank with them. After a few phone calls, it came to light we needed to go into branch. Transaction and service in the branch was great, account opening process from there was immediate and we had our cards two days later. I did raise a complaint on the advisory of staff over the phone, and today I received a full credit of all money spent on the phone to them and a lovely hamper for the inconvenience. What a lovely treat! Thank you BANK_NAME, truly surprised and touched by a thoughtful sentiment. "
Customer_1083, Only Attempt to Open a Business Account!! ," I have been a BANK_NAME customer for 20 years and have found the bank in general to be good (or at least better than others). However, I am now considering closing my account purely based on the frustrations in my attempt to open up a business account. I have been attempting to open a business account for 3 months!Initially I attempted to open the account within my local branch. They said that this was impossible and that I had to call them. They provided me with a number and kindly suggested a use the phone in one of there meeting rooms. I spent 2 hrs on the phone waiting and eventually being cut off. They then suggested that the best way would be to submit online, I have submitted 2 x applications over the past 2 months and I'm still awaiting a reply. The online applications are particularly time consuming which I dont mind as long as there is a result at the end of it. I visited my local branch today and asked if they could help. They gave me another number to call. Once again I have been on the phone for 2 hrs. The message says that I'm in a queue. Then eventually after 15 mins it rings out. I no longer have a choice but to close all my accounts and move bank. My preference is to have all my accounts with the one bank but as this is not possible with BANK_NAME I will be forced to move. Please do not waste time trying to open a business account with this bank even if you are a lifelong customer. This is not the same with other banks. I have previously opened business accounts with other banks but due to the fact no one is willing to discuss issues face to face you are left with no option. Incredibly frustrating!! "
Customer_1084, BANK_NAME- BUNCH OF RUND UNHELPFUL COWBOYS ! ," I have been a BANK_NAME customer for several years and if i have ever had a complaint they were usually more than helpful, well this all changed on 30th may. i had a complaint up held and was compensated for this, i then found out that what i had agreed hadn't been carried out and was left paying bank charges, i paid the bank charges and then re activated my complaint- 17 days later, 5hrs worth of calling and after being told my complaint wasn't a priority as i was lucky enough that my account wasn't effected by their banking issues, i got called a lair and then also was told that they agreed i had been treated rubbish but were doing nothing about it ! much to my horror ! they are disgusting and as for their customer service or lack of, the staff are rude misleading and as for trying to get a call back, ridiculous! As a result of the disgraceful service i have now opened a new account with another company !! Avoid BANK_NAME and RBS with a barge pole. unless your issues have been public and national news they will do JACK to help ! Id rather store my money in a glass box on my roof than with them ! Would have given minus stars if i could !!! HORRID GOOD FOR NOTHING RUDE WASTE OF TIME AND SPACE ! "
Customer_1085, I have been locked out of my account … , I have been locked out of my account and it is absolutely disgusting i have payments to make and they want me to go into the store with my id when i had just been into store in the last week to withdraw money and I'm so not happy with where i am at the moment cause i have built up my credit with in my account and i cant afford to leave this bank and move to another bank cause I've been with this bank for so long and all I've done is use all their services. I have never spoken to the staff in a bad way but i have been on hold for about 45 minutes now and some of their staff members are saying they can't do anything about it yet again some of the staff are happy to say the department is open and they are putting me though to someone... i feel like the phone will cut off again seen as that keeps happening seriously this bank needs to get a GRIP!!! 
Customer_1086, BE AWARE!!! AVOID !!! CLOSED MY ACCOUNT WITHOUT REASON!!!! ," I have been using BANK_NAME for the past three years while I have been a student in London. For the past three years I have been using BANK_NAME to pay for phone bills, rent and on-line transactions.One day I woke up to find out that my account had been closed and I could no longer work with BANK_NAME. I was given no reason whatsoever. Now I cannot pay my bills and rent and as I am an international student I cannot do anything in the UK. It is unbelievable on how they can just close your account and give you no reason at all. Please do not leave comments about all this fraudulent activity suspicions that I have read on-line. I state again that I am an undergraduate at UCL and I have been only using my account as a mean to pay for direct debits and on-line transactions.Be aware! "
Customer_1087, I have been with BANK_NAME for over 30 … ," I have been with BANK_NAME for over 30 years, I applied for a Buy to let mortgage through the Romford branch which turned into the most frustrating experience. I though being a customer who, was working as a contractor earning good money and has had personal and business accounts and have never had any issue money wise and they can see a healthy balance and a regular income from rental property that it would be in my favour and should not be a problem. I was turned down on their generic criteria that I didn't meet, they took nothing into consideration and the 'advisor' couldn't be bothered to help, he never returned phone calls or emails then blaming his phone for not working, I complained to the Romford branch manager about the service and was told I would be receiving an apology and gift through the post, which turned out to be a box of cadburys chocolates which I took back and dumped on the desk only to be told that was all they could do. We lost the property we were hoping to buy because of these people.  I cant go into a lot of detail here as its just too long but I have been looking for an ethical bank in to which I can transfer my money and close my accounts down with BANK_NAME and at last I have found one. There is no personal touch with these banks anymore, all I wanted to do at the time was to open a mortgage with BANK_NAME and not for a great deal of money either , 95k , but they don't take into consideration  your personal circumstance by the looks of things, they just tick boxes. "
Customer_1088, Never bank with BANK_NAME ," I have been with BANK_NAME for 34 years and was recently scammed by someone who knew all my information and claimed to be from BANK_NAME fraud. The result was we had all our money stolen and overdrawn to the limit. We owe thousands and have had no help from BANK_NAME whatsoever. They offered us a loan, taking us further into debt.It doesn't seem to matter to BANK_NAME that we have nothing. The scammer took everything we own. They do not care at all. 34 years means nothing. Find a bank who believe in customer service. Worse bank ever. "
Customer_1089, Stop blocking my card of suspected fraud!!! ," I have been with BANK_NAME for about 18 months. Initially, I was happy with the bank and service received, until this year (2014). I'm starting to earn more money at work so this means I can take more trips abroad. BANK_NAME have blocked my card when booking every trip! (This isn't the part that bothers me as it shows that they have strict security)! The part that bothers me is that I'm not told!! I don't receive an email or a phone-call. The only time that I find out is when I try to pay for something by card in a shop! How embarrassing to know that I have money in my bank account; but can't use my card! I asked my local bank about whether they've thought to contact me and their response was: No"
Customer_1090, Confidentiality issues!! ," I have been with BANK_NAME for over 10 years and until now couldn't fault them. I set up a joint account with my boyfriend 2 months ago. All well and good but after waiting a month they finally got in contact with me and told me we had to pick up our cards. We get there and they are missing a card. Now they have to close our account and spend another hour setting up a new one.Worse still they have changed my mobile number twice this week without me requesting them too and have started sending my private account details and amounts to my bf. Not the shared account information but my own, private account. BANK_NAME need to sort out their service and actually respond to their customers. I've tried calling them and emailing them at my branch and they haven't got back to me. "
Customer_1091, I have been with BANK_NAME for over 15 … ," I have been with BANK_NAME for over 15 years and in that time not even one issue! I recently applied for a car loan and was allowed to go online to see if I was accepted BEFORE I applied so there was no mark left on my credit file. Applied at 5pm and money was in my account the following day.I have had no fraud, no issues, the call centre staff are all polite and helpful. Obviously everyone jumps on Trustpilot if they have had a bad experience but I would also encourage people who have good experiences too to leave reviews.  Would highly recommend BANK_NAME who, if they know your history, are fantastic. Can't fault anything about them. "
Customer_1092, I have been with BANK_NAME for over 33 … ," I have been with BANK_NAME for over 33 years, just received a letter to say their bank charges are more than doubling.  I threatened that I will leave them, they could not care less.BANK_NAME, I am taking away at least 10 million in turnover from you.Thanks for being loyal "
Customer_1093, No idea how to treat customers , I have been with BANK_NAME for over 45 years which seems to count for nothing. Yesterday whilst trying to set up telephone banking over the phone we encountered a rude arrogant and incompetent man who said it was impossible to do. He said we had to fill everything out on line. I am not interested in on line banking due to security issues and alike and will never put my details for banking on line. He then flatly refused to progress our telephone banking so we asked to be transferred to complaints dept who seemed to have no problem setting it up and were courteous too. What a w**k*r the first man was! 
Customer_1094, BANK_NAME is the worst bank I have ever had the displeasure to be part of. ," I have been with BANK_NAME for some years now, never been overdrawn I have good credit rating. I went to pay for some goods last Sunday and my card declined I found this hard to believe as I have over six thousand pounds in the account. I contacted the bank they told me a letter had been sent out in December they could not tell me the content. I had not received any letter. I had no cash and had to visit a local branch they told me they had closed my account and when I asked why they wouldn't give me the reason why. I now have to apply further to get my money back. I have no money until I get them to release it into another account that I have to supply the details for. This level of service is utterly disgusting. In light of this I have several friends and family that own companies that will be leaving BANK_NAME and I will continue to discourage anyone to use or continue using this bank for some time to come "
Customer_1095, The worst service and customer treatment around , I have been with BANK_NAME over 20 years and the customer service has got worst and the charges get higher. I put in a complaint early on the webchat and was told I had to sign in to complaints. No ownership and had to ask that maybe a complaints handler call me. Long and short is that this bank will charge and charge you and then suddenly all their products don't apply to you and they just keep hitting you harder and harder every month under the title - Helpful Banking. I pray I get a payrise at work because the first thing I will do it switch bank and be happy 
Customer_1096, No customer loyalty and poor service. However their account security is excellent ," I have been with BANK_NAME since I was 14, and previously had a loan with them which had been paid in full and without any issues. However my credit score plummeted after I lost my job and couldn’t make appropriate arrangements with my creditors at the time. When my financial situation improved I was hoping to get a debt consolidation loan but was rejected immediately. I have applied 2 more times over 5 years and have been turned down again. Two decades of a good relationship with my bank apparently don’t have anything to do with the decision to lend to me, they just make a cold and impersonal evaluation and run with it. However the security of my account has been excellent, I nearly became a victim of fraud a few years back with a fraudulent company taking small amounts of money from my account which were increasing slightly each time. BANK_NAME recognised the transactions might be fraudulent and stopped the payments. They also notified me, cancelled my debit card and put my account on fraud alert which was a huge help as I could have lost a lot of money if BANK_NAME hadn’t responded so quickly. "
Customer_1097, Thieves ," I have been with BANK_NAME since I was 16 and I can honestly say when you in hardship with money, they make it ten times worse.I have been in a loop of bank charges for the last three years and I have asked for help numerous times but have had none.It was only this morning that I spoke to 1 person who for the first time in years has told me about an account that wouldno be taking £90 a month in charges from me !!I have made numerous complaints that have been to do with charges and they have always disagreed with me.I would not recommend BANK_NAME to anybody and I am definitely leaving them as of today.They take advantage of people who struggle with money and don't offer any solution. "
Customer_1098," Uncaring, unfeeling institution irrelevant of length of time bank account held "," I have been with BANK_NAME since my 16th Birthday, I am now 40.I have always, and still am fully employed on a very good salary.A few years ago I found myself in the unfortunate position where my wife left me and left me in a significant amount of debt. We had a 5 year old daughter together who is with me (now a single father).My credit history up to the point of the split had been excellent. After the split, my daughter and I were living hand-to-mouth literally having pennies at the end of each month. As you can imagine the past few years have been incredibly stressfull for me whilst I repay every single penny of the outstanding money (no banktruptcy etc - just paying off it all bit by bit), especially given that it's just my little girl and I.On more than one occassion i called the BANK_NAME helpline towards the end of a month asking for them to extend my overdraft limit by £50 or so, just for a week, until I got paid, and then lower it again to revert to the 'normal' level of £100.I explained the situation outlined above and that the temporary uplify was just so that I could get some bandwidth for a week in order to feed my daughter and I.Each and every time I was faced with a cold, uncaring, harsh rebuttal from the 'customer service' representative. One time I was told that my card would be frozen and that I'd have to go in to my local brance to 'plead' with the bank manager in order to be 'allowed' to have £10. This was on a saturday evening...........(no banks open on Sundays).I didn't smoke, drink, gamble etcThe amount of times that this awful bank has had me feeling like a failure of a Dad, and left me in tears, is unforgiveable, especially as I'd been with them for all of my adult life to date.I am now completely out of debt having repaid every single thing, with an ongoing wage of circa £70k per year.I am now in the process of moving to BANK_NAME Bank and BANK_NAME will never see another single penny of my money/savings.A disgustingly awful bank in my opinion. "
Customer_1099, ........and relax ! ," I have been with them for 33 years, had six mortgages with them, and paid them 100s of thousands in mortgage interest. Trying to set up a new mortgage, waited over a month for face to face appointment because phone service is impossibly difficult, then turned up to find no record of appointment and person I was meeting has left the business. I had even rung the central number and fought through options to say I was going to be 10 mins late an hour before !!! Since then been treated like a criminal every time I call especially when I ask for someone by name. Told that advisors don't take inbound calls you will have to e mail and they will call you back. Wasted untold stressful hours trying to be a customer this week so now will be settling my mortgage off as soon as I can, closing my bank accounts and going elsewhere where they care about their customers. Oh yes, and after being asked about 100 times by my branch if I do online banking they are now closing it. I did tell the great staff there that it was a bad idea to be so persistent ! Please BANK_NAME sort yourselves out before you put yourselves out of business entirely ! "
Customer_1100, The bank that keeps moving forward. ," I have been with them for over 20 years and in all this time i have never had any issues. I recently opened a young persons card account for my daughter due to the good service i have received, Had a little issue getting her set up online and needed to call them but they answered within 10 mins and were fab! Their online account manager and mobile app are outstanding and there really is no need to go to a branch much these days. I did call last week to take a cheque and loose cash and they were so helpful and friendly.Im surprised at all the negative feedback and would suggest reading your T&Cs and managing your own accounts.

Customer_1101, total frustration , I have come to the end of my tether with this bank after being with them for over 25 years - they are just not fit for purpose any more - absolute rubbish service 
Customer_1102, Rubbish bank for businesses , I have decided to move away from BANK_NAME after 25 years. Their business/commercial teams are rubbish and they are way behind other banks. 
Customer_1103, Best Service I Have Ever Recieved from ANY Bank!! ," I have done banking with BANK_NAME, HSBC, BANK_NAME, BANK_NAME, Halifax. Now I have closed all of them except BANK_NAME. They provide best customer service. There was few issues with their debit card at pay at pump and they promised me they are trying to resolve it and guess what after six months they solved the problem. The online banking is great and I feel more secure with BANK_NAME. Login, money transfer, paying bills, online statements everything great.Customer service always close to your hands via the online chat. "
Customer_1104, I have got to admit they have one of … , I have got to admit they have one of the worst customer service in UK. Not the first time i have talked with very rude and arrogant advicer. Considering changing my bank account provider 
Customer_1105, Time to Move to Another Bank , I have had a business account with BANK_NAME for over a year now. To my horror part of BANK_NAME Direct Business has been sold to Santander including our account which if you know Santander's level of customer complaints this is my opinion was a bad move.As a small business we expect every now and then to incur charges but the last amount applied by BANK_NAME tipped us over the edge and i vowed if applied to move.I have always been advised by BANK_NAME branch advisors that any cash paid in over the counter was available immediately. It mattered not if paid in over the counter or through their internal cash machine.One Friday at 5.15pm i deposited £250.00 into our business account. The account balance confirmed this amount was available to use. Later that evening i transferred money online to a creditor. To my disgust when i received our pre-advice charges later that month i noticed a £30.00 charge had been applied for going overdrawn that day as the money credited had not been 'credited' to our credit to the following Monday. Immediately i went in to the branch concerned complaining about the charge taking all documentation including my receipt stating the money had been deposited and shown as being available to withdraw. They photocopied the information and said they would investigate my complaint. Around a week later i got a letter from them stating they had investigated and was sorry but the charge was to remain as it had been applied in line with the accounts terms and conditions.Disgusted i tried to telephone the person directly and was told she was on lunch and was informed i would get a return call. I took the time that evening to write to the individual. The phone call never came and i have to date not received a reply. The charge was subsequently applied to my account.On that basis and for other issues i have experienced in the past i have decided to close our account as their slogan ‘Here to help’ no longer seems to apply.I will complain to the Financial Ombudsmen but hold little faith in their action as i have never had any luck with them in the past; i sometimes wonder who funds them? 
Customer_1106, Second rate banking service , I have had many problems over the years with this outfit but today takes the cream. My salary has not been paid in and I phoned the emergency line - one hour and no reply and then I had to go back to work. I see online that they are saying it will be Saturday before I see my money. Is this legalised theft by a bunch who pay themselves huge bonuses ...? 
Customer_1107, Remortgage rates uncompetative , I have had my mortgage with BANK_NAME for 12 years. My current fixed rate deal is coming to an end but the rates they were offering for my new deal were too high compared to other mortgages on the market. I called them to see if they could offer a loyal customer any incentive to stay e.g. cash back or reduced fees. I was told bluntly no and I can't put you through to anyone who will say any different. I am now in the process of changing to Barnsley Building Society. 
Customer_1108, Avoid at all cost! ," I have had such a bad experience with this bank and don't want to bore you with the details.£6 a month charge on our business account for no reason. Tried closing account several times and they won't allow me.Sorry excuse for a bank.Take your money and stuff it in a mattress, then putting it in this so called bank.Banking ombudsman have made a complaint on my behalf.Will keep you updated if Trustpilot don't delete my negative review.They seem to help business more than consumers.Probably because businesses pay them Thousands a year. "
Customer_1109," Rude, unhelpful and not willing "," I have just been to the BANK_NAME bank at Dean street, to open a new account with them. As they were recommended by my partner and we wanted to open a joint account together for further savings and banking. This was my third time this week to visit them to try to speak to somebody. Finally managed to find someone who would look into this for me. But I have to say I have never been treated so bad in my entire life. It was almost like they were trying to make me feel bad so I would leave, as they said it takes over an hour to set up an account. Really don't feel comfortable with a bank that makes you this angry "
Customer_1110, Worst bank evet ," I have just finished a 2 hour call to their complaints team and I am still no further along in getting a resolution. I do not bank with them,  I was talking on behalf of my partner. All he wanted to do was amend a standing order but couldn't because it wasn't a working day before. In this day and age there is no such thing as a 'working day' really when it comes to banking. We have apps that allow us to access our accounts 24/7 365. However I am not new to this and  work in the finance industry so I understand they might have system restrictions,  the crux of the complaint stems from the fact that their own website answer for 'how do I amend or cancel a standing order?' says you can call our telephone banking department or go into a branch up to 6pm the day before. Not working day, the DAY before. Add to this the 5 hours of phone calls in less than 24 hours and needless to say my partner will be moving his account. They are without a doubt the worst bank I have ever had the displeasure to deal with and given my job this is a bold statement. Terrible customer service and appalling complaints resolution, and by that I mean they don't resolve your complaint! Stay far, far away from this bank and go somewhere like COOP for the ethical stance or First Direct for customer service. "
Customer_1111, Very poor attitude to customers ," I have my account for years with no problems, always in credit and regular payments going in. I recently noted an error where I have requested an online payment be made- unfortunately I had duplicated the payment request. This was a large sum of money that would leave me overdrawn. I contacted the bank before 18.30hrs- which BANK_NAME say is their cut off time  I requested they stop the duplicate payment- they refused and then sent me a letter saying they would charge me £6.00 but then THEY took the £6.00 fee from my account twice.Absolutely rubbish with no respect for their long term good customers.now switching to another bank - would previously have recommended them but NEVER again. "
Customer_1112, Stay away! ," I have no bad credit, an excellent credit file after never missing a payment (inc. BANK_NAMEs mortgage and they actually sent me a letter saying I could remortgage WITHOUT CHECKS!!) and no problems whatsoever but BANK_NAME have declined me a mortgage based on how I conducted my current account. What they mean is, I recently closed my current account with a £200 overdraft facility down and they don't like it. The new mortgage would see my pay them £400 less a month and they don't like that either. It's absolutely disgraceful, and they have now left me with a black mark meaning its going to be very difficult to get another strong rate elsewhere. Stay away from them. "
Customer_1113, not bad ," i have no trouble with BANK_NAME, it is good for most things but it does cause trouble for my daughter as you cannot use the online banking service unless your 16 or over which i do not understand. If your old enough to have an account why can't you look at a summary without having to find time to travel to an atm? "
Customer_1114, BANK_NAME front street Arnold Nottingham ," I have recently been into the bank on 2 occasions to withdraw money (first time in years) by cheque. On both occasions I have queued for half an hour and then had to leave. The new set up doesn't work. 1 person serving? 10 people in the queue. No staff bat an eyelid. The women greeting people and saying have a lovely day...... GET ON THE WORKSTATION. YOU RUN A CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATION. HAVE YOU ALL FORGOTTEN??? I have been with BANK_NAME for 35 years but am moving as soon as I can. Worst customer service I have experienced for years, ANYWHERE. sort it out BANK_NAME. You must know, why else would there be a sign up saying rude and abusive behaviour to staff will not be tolerated? Rubbish service and being ignored won't either you clowns. "
Customer_1115, Cheque Fraud! ," I have recently been the victim of fraud, I have had two cheques that have been taken out of my account, looking at BANK_NAME's policies it states that: 'We (BANK_NAME) are committed to protecting our customersOur detection system looks out for unusual patterns on your account, and if we notice anything of concern, we may contact you using our automated system or an operator to help protect you against fraud.' Unfortunately I as many other people seem to have been overlooked in this situation, thus showing this policy rarely applies.In the space of a few days two cheques have been cashed, I myself have never used my chequebook in the time I have banked with BANK_NAME, therefore does this not constitute an unusual pattern?I contacted the fraud team as per the website, and spoke to an advisor regarding the whole situation, the advisor was rude and unsympathetic towards the issue in hand.I asked the advisor why it states that they notice unusual patterns on customer accounts when in fact they had not picked up the fact I had never used a cheque once, the advisor was rude throughout, I then queried the next steps of the fraud and he advised it will be resolved and nothing will happen again, I also requested that I am informed of where the cheque went however have heard nothing since.I queried why the funds were taken from my account, however the advisor treated me as if I didn't know anything, and told me the cheque had not been processed yet I queried why it was showing on my statement, with no response given.The second cheque cashed on my account only a few days after the first was not picked up by the fraud team, therefore my trust for BANK_NAME has completely vanished.I contacted BANK_NAME again regarding the second cheque and was advised it has been cashed and it was worrying that this is the second cheque cashed on my account.Now all I can do is wait for BANK_NAME to 'resolve' the issue once again!I also up until now could not fault BANK_NAME on their policies, but unfortunately after this issue I would prefer to bank elsewhere. "
Customer_1116," Banks often get bad press, but is it deserved? "," I have to say I find BANK_NAME head and shoulders above other Banks when it comes to customer service. They really listen and understand my needs, and will go out their way to come up with the right solution, for me, not them. Well done BANK_NAME, keep it up "
Customer_1117, Terrible customer service ," I have used this bank for 16 years and suddenly customer service is shocking. 3 weeks if chasing things round and still no positive outcome. Sick and tired of being told I would receive a call back to never receive one. Will not recommend, now looking at leaving "
Customer_1118, Caring and understanding , I just had my card stolen and BANK_NAME were extremely helpful in returning my money and making sure that i was able to take money out of my account.This was extremely helpful because I had no food or electric left! The customer service was great. Thank you BANK_NAME. 
Customer_1119, Love the App! ," I know many people have written negative reviews but the service I have received from BANK_NAME over the last 5 years has been incredible. They listen to you and help give you the best service they can. Although their branches are some of the worst branches available in the UK, the online banking is out of this world. The one thing that pushes BANK_NAME way in front of any other bank is their good looking, easy to use Mobile App! "
Customer_1120, I left a very unfavourable review for … , I left a very unfavourable review for BANK_NAME card services because I was not happy with my treatment over the way and attitude that my complaint of my platinum credit cards fraudulent use was dealt with.I appealed the decision to decline my claim after leaving my review on trust pilot...afew days after leaving the review I was contacted by BANK_NAME who looked at my complaint and I was dealt with in a completely different manner my investigation into the fraudulent use of my card was dealt with in a professional way from this point onwards and was sorted amicably. So I would now like to thank both trust pilot and BANK_NAME for their  help in this matter 
Customer_1121," Always make out things will be quick, but in reality is the total opposite - terrible service "," I lost my Debit Card early last week and rang BANK_NAME up and they sounded very efficient (as they normally do) and said that my new card would be with me in 3 working days......... well it is a week now and i still haven't received it!This is nothing new as a year or so ago i rang up for a replacement card as mine was so old and the first one got lost, and it took two weeks to get the new one! Also i have asked for another service which involves paperwork (and this was supposed to be quick so i was told!) and it must be 3 weeks now since i first started it! Terrible service.BANK_NAME need to get their act together! "
Customer_1122, Extremely poor processes and systems ," I lost my wallet and wanted to block my cards. Initially phone them up and was asked very specific account numbers which I didn't have on me.  Eventually thy found a way to search for my name and address (basis!) and then asked me security questions.  I failed on a security question about a direct debit to a credit card. I couldn't answer how much my last direct debit was, because I didn't know the amount. Obviously I don't know the amount as that's the reason for setting up the direct debit - not to worry about these numbers! Because I failed this question, I couldn't block my cards and had to go through a different team.  This team was busy and didn't answer for 15 minutes so gave up. Once I phoned back, I got through and found out I had to go through two different teams to cancel my credit card and debit car - ridiculous! Lastly to my astonishement one team said my credit card would be deivered int he next 10 days and the other said the debit card would be deliver in the next 4 days.  What a useless system.  I am wanting my card to be at least a cheap second class post in the next two days and at least have the same times scales for different cards! This just annoys me because BANK_NAME has very poor processes and my job is to sort out these poor processes and put common sense back into systems! "
Customer_1123, I love BANK_NAME , I love BANK_NAME.  I have seen complaints on other sites but since i have been with them i have only had one problem and that was immediately sorted out via your very helpful customer service   i like that i can call and talk to a real person and not go through tons of automated sayings on the telephone.  I realise technology has progressed and your app is great.  So i think you should get a good review for doing a great job and being there if things go wrong.  Stay human dont ever go to automated.  Thanks 
Customer_1124, I must say the standards with Nat-west … ," I must say the standards with Nat-west banking are falling and the phone customer services is terrible, today asked about a transaction only to be talked over by a rather rude and impertinent lady and was not helpful at all!!! "
Customer_1125, absolute joke of a bank , I never had a problem in the 4 years I've been with BANK_NAME then i put an account switch in to change to Halifax and surprise surprise I get my account locked. All my money in BANK_NAME and they block it 3 days before Christmas. Passed to 5 different departments then answer I get is can't discuss please wait for a letter?? Absolute joke. Ruined mine and my children's Christmas. Steer clear 
Customer_1126, Terrible online banking ," I only use access my BANK_NAME account through the online banking website. It's a very out-dated website and needs to be redesigned. Adding payees and changing details is a real hassle and it's not user-friendly at all. They need to take a lesson from other banks or look at tech companies like Amazon and copy their clean layouts, secure logins, simple navigation, and helpful links. "
Customer_1127, BANK_NAME Kidderminster - Rude & dishonest staff ," I opened a bank account with National & Provincial - which became BANK_NAME - in 1965. My mother, who is now 78, already had an account at that time, so I guess she has been an account holder for around 60 years. Which means her account is older than any of the staff in the Kidderminster branch of BANK_NAME.However, this did not stop a member of staff at the Kidderminster branch from closing my mother's account without her permission, and stealing the balance. What, you assumed she was dead????Nor did it stop a member of staff at the Kidderminster branch from closing the door in my mother's face, preventing her from entering the bank to pay in a cheque after you had a premium bond win.The Kidderminster branch manager needs to address training in customer care, and to establish why my mother's bank account was plundered.I still have my BANK_NAME account.....not sure how much longer for, though. It sounds as though my money would be safer under the mattress, and I wouldn't have to deal with any of the rude, dishonest, poorly trained staff in the Kidderminster branch of BANK_NAME.I hope my mother contacts the police, not just for her sake, but for other elderly Kidderminster residents who face being abused by the staff of BANK_NAME. "
Customer_1128, Worst experience ," I opened a new account a few weeks before. I am new to UK and working professional. I got my salary credited in BANK_NAME account and now I was trying to transfer my money to my home country.First they wanted me to get a card reader for doing on-line transfers. I tried with my debit card and that did not work and now my debit card got blocked and today morning even my on-line banking doesn't work. When I called them, they are asking me to wait for 5 to 10 days and they will call me back. This is kind of worst service which I have never heard of anywhere in the world. My family is dependant on me and I am now worried of transferring the money... "
Customer_1129, 4 Weeks wait for a debit card , I ordered a new contactless card before Christmas to replace a stolen one. No sign of the card after Christmas. Ring the bank - the order was never processed. Order a new contactless card - a week goes by and a card arrives. The card is not contactless and the pin does not work. The card is useless. I am now awaiting a new debit card from BANK_NAME to replace the card that was stolen a month ago. I could cry with frustration. It is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. 
Customer_1130, Customer Service , I panicked when I checked my account this morning and called customer service pretty angry but Connor Taylor was excellent in calming me down and dealing with my request quickly and sufficiently. Thank you. 
Customer_1131, Terrible changes to online banking. ," I pay my landlord every month using online banking with my credit card. Have done it every month for coming on two years.Tried to do it today, and they have removed the feature. All you can now do is make payments to your card, that's it. Pay yourself.When did they make the change, a few days ago, did they let me know, no. So now my only option for paying my landlord is to call BANK_NAME every month and pass all the security questions blah blah blah. Will I now be late on paying my rent, yes I will.A thirty minute call. Not fun. But I was told that they hope this feature will return to the online site. "
Customer_1132, Liars ," I phoned BANK_NAME to take out a mortgage with them. The deal seemed too good to be true. The mortgage set up fee was £595. They told me that once the mortgage had completed they would write to me requesting the set up fee and I could send a cheque or pay over the telephone.2 days later I checked my bank balance and they had taken the £595 out of my account without my permission. It took 18 phone calls to get the money refunded. BANK_NAME told me that I agreed to have the money taken from my account (which is a lie). They soon changed their tune when I told them I had recorded the initial telephone call stating clearly they wouldn't take the money. This company also get the surveyor to under value your property so you are not entitled to the lower re-mortgage rate. They under valued out house by £20,000 (according to an independent surveyor). An awful, awful company that lie to get your business, BEWARE "
Customer_1133, Absolutely disgusting attitude towards customers ," I previously closed my account with BANK_NAME because my account was hacked 3 times in one year.  My teen daughter still had an account however as I wanted her to have a debit card instead of carrying cash.  I always made sure that there wasn't large amounts in her account though through fear of hacking.  Unfortunately, her card was refused in a store this week, even though the funds were there as I'd transferred them that morning.  She went into branch and asked for help and the rude cashier just said 'you can't spend the money because it takes 5 days'.  That's rubbish as I transfer all the time this way.  We went on live chat who confirmed the transfer had cleared and the cashier 'SHOULD NOT' have given that information as it doesn't take that long.  As the live chat went on the adviser became very rude and even spoke to us like we were thick.  Absolutely appalling to be spoken to in such a manor.  I am now closing her account and opening her a Halifax account. I've had a secondary account with Halifax for 15 years now and never had any security issues, never had unauthorised payments and the staff are always polite.  Maybe BANK_NAME workers could learn alot from them.If BANK_NAME are reading this, please put all staff on a course that will help them with regards of how to treat its customers.  Also, it would be great if they had more knowledge on BANK_NAME considering they work for them.Disappointing behaviour from both branch and online services. "
Customer_1134, BANK_NAME is crap ," I realised I had lost my card wallet with my Nationwide and BANK_NAME cards a couple of hours ago (Its now 10.10pm in the UK - Saturday night).  I rang Nationwide. They answered within 2 rings and it was cancelled in 5mins flat. I rang BANK_NAME, on their dedicated 'report lost card' line. They kept me holding for 20 minutes with a rolling message telling me they were experiencing a high volume of calls and would be with me shortly (at 10pm on a Saturday night??).  This was clearly never going to happen, so I went onto their live chat and tried asking advice there. Got a stupid 'we can only cancel cards between 8am and 6pm' response from somewhere probably on other side of world.  BANK_NAME is seriously crap. "
Customer_1135, Bunch of Cowboys - 1 star is far to generous , I recently changed my bank from BANK_NAME to Bank of Scotland due to me moving to Scotland and there being no BANK_NAME branches locally. To my horror once my account was closed with BANK_NAME they had lumbered me with £182 charges . I phoned them to see what the charges were for and they told me that i had overspent on my card even though i have no overdraft ????? Please note this is debit card so if no monies are in the account the transaction at the point of sale will not go through. I called them to explain this and they put me through to the complaints department where i was on hold for 20 mins and then the complaints department said i was through to the wrong complaints department and put me on hold for another 20 mins. Steer clear of this bank as all they seem to do is pass you from pillar to post charge you extortionate rates for doing nothing at all plus ive noticed i have been paying £15 a month for a service i never use and this service has been putting me overdrawn each month. So im getting charged for their charge. Stay clear of BANK_NAME and any other subsidiaries . All banks are run by the same group's so no matter where you go you will always be banking with a cowboy company whether you like it or not 
Customer_1136, Harrassing phone calls ," I recently got a new phone line when I had internet installed. Immediately, the phone calls started from some unknown number. They kept asking for a woman who does not and has never lived at my address. I told them this time and again and they still refused to stop calling. I asked them to update their records and still they wouldn't. The person calling would never introduce themselves, or explain why they were calling, which I find appallingly rude. I eventually looked up the phone number to find a few people had experienced similar treatment. I rang the number to find that in fact it was BANK_NAME Home Insurance! I thought it was some kind of debt collection agency the way they were acting! I forwarded  a complaint via their website telling them to sod off (mostly politely) and I recieved a letter saying they would look into my complaint. I have not had any further letters but hurrah, they have stopped calling me! "
Customer_1137, Opaque M.O. ," I recently made an electronic transfer from my UK BANK_NAME account to an account in Hong Kong. The BANK_NAME website showed the transaction as having been effected, with the approximate date of arrival in the recipient account two days afterward. Over a week after the original order, the money is not showing in the recipient account. I phone BANK_NAME and, after lots of just putting you on hold"" music"
Customer_1138, The worst website imaginable ," I spent about half an hour making a system of pins and passwords (without ever being asked for proper security questions, mind you) to set up online banking. I set it up, and find out (having hunted down and entered all of my mum's details) that I can't even make a transfer to someone who transfers to me without a stupid card reader. I've just entered every silly detail imaginable to join but apparently, only a piece of plastic going to the address I can clearly see online would make me safe. I can't do it with telephone banking either - instead I must order a card reader, and wait up to seven days for it to arrive. That made me cross - what made me angry enough to complain is that I couldn't f'ing find card readers on their website. Under payments? No, it just says to have one. Under my details, or under my accounts? Nothing. When you google 'BANK_NAME card reader', instructions on how to get the damn things is the eighth result down. I decided to complain - but BANK_NAME does not have an open complaints form, you have to sign up to being phoned in your own home. I don't want a cold caller, I want to make it clear the website and the whole system is blinking awful. I was prepared to complain privately, but their trashy complaints form means the only place for it is a public review.My time has been wasted, and my enjoyable evening ruined. And I can't even set up my money transfer. "
Customer_1139, Birmingham Call Centre ," I spoke with Davina within your call centre in birmingham, I will not go into details what about, but she was so kind and understanding, she helped me so much and gave me great advise. She is a credit to your customer service team and your company. Thank you so much "
Customer_1140, Business Banking - Incredibly Poor Experience ," I started my business 5 years ago and have been banking with BANK_NAME for the entirety, which has been a very poor experience. Most recently I have spent hours on the phone to their customer service team to resolve a minor matter, which is still yet to be done. They are closing all the local branches in my area (Brighton and Hove) and their telephone service team are incompetent at resolving situations, leaving me with no options.If it weren't for the major hassle required to change over our accounts I would have left in a heartbeat. I run another business with which I bank with HSBC and it is a considerably superior experience. "
Customer_1141, I took my complaint to BANK_NAME Twice.  Joke ," I took my complaint to BANK_NAME. i got a curt and rude reply, Contacted CEO Office complaint reviewed same as before. i explained the faults. No error on BANK_NAME part ?. When has bad customer service not been a fault. James Thomson "
Customer_1142, Disgraceful , I tried to purchase my euros online and due to BANK_NAME not doing as they was requested back in January To change my address the company couldn't continue with my request. Iv been fighting BANK_NAME since Tuesday untold phone calls and still they haven't put the money back into my account !! They are a total disgrace that have caused me no end of stress......... 0 star rating 
Customer_1143, charged me for using my debit card!! , I used my debit card to make a purchase which went through fine. Although after checking my statement they have taken a £35 fee as they gave me an overdraft which I never asked for. I elxplained that you should not have authorised the transaction as this is a debit card and you can not authorise transactions when there is nothing in my account. They said they treat this as an informal overdraft request and that it is my responsibility to ensure I remain in credit! What total nonsense. totally illegal and unfair. I have tried on numberous occasions to get this money refunded but they simply think they are always in the right. Also second problem:Charged me £7 to receive a payment from abroad the money was sent in pound sterling and therefore this was not a currency conversion fee.I have a Halifax account also and Halifax do not charge a fee they only charge a currency conversion fee. BANK_NAME deliberabtely make it hard to find there fees on there website as I checked afterwards. There isa interest rates are some of the worst in the market also. If anything goes wrong they are very reluctant to refund any fees. Do yourself a favour change bank accounts. 
Customer_1144, I visit BANK_NAME branch at Stockton-on-Tees High Street ," I visit BANK_NAME branch at Stockton-on-Tees High Street (10:45 on 03/05/2017) to send some money to my son's account as he was at Newcastle hospital and waiting for the money. The lady who was on the customer desk asked me is the regular payment or one off payment which I said I do sometime when he need extra money and she said I can do only this time as the rules has been changed and she can not accept sending money over the counter, I said its weird rules and I never heard about it and if I want to send money you can't say that but she said yes i will do only this time but next time I have to refuse!!!!! Is that really new law? I tried to find complaint phone line to speak with BANK_NAME but I couldn't find anything. I would like to leave a very bad review as I think she didn't treat me nice and I didn't like the customer service and I never recommend BANK_NAME to anyone and I asked my son to close his account with BANK_NAME. its a really shame. "
Customer_1145, No Availability Of Business Managers ," I was mis-sold a business banking package. The most important feature for me was face to face contact as due to lots of errors during the opening of the account last year and when they lost £5000 of my personal money, the phone service was appalling and I ended up being compensated. I chose an account that stated'A Business Manager team - to offer support either face to face or by phone.'When I requested a meeting, i was told that they do not offer this service and that they are allowed to advertise it as they use the word either. I think this is misleading as they could offer anything and get away with it if they use the word either. If a breakdown company said, they could either take you to the nearest approved garage free or take you to any UK address at 50p a mile and you had a flat tyre 200 miles from home. if you requested to be taken to the nearest garage and they refused saying they had the word either in their advertising, you would be furious as you would need to pay £100 to get home. This is how I feel that the bank should offer what they advertise or not be allowed to advertise it. "
Customer_1146, Appalling customer service ," I was unable to log in to on-line business banking and was made to re-register. After 14 days i am still unable to log in.The whole set up is totally ridiculous if you have a problem . Even the complaint line keeps you waiting an unreasonable length of time to answer.You would think the first point of call would be your business manager but he is either unable or unwilling to put himself out.All phone lines keep you waiting ages and often your directed to a web chat ,probably with someone in another country,who are unable to help. BANK_NAME customer service is obviously a low priority. I am now in the process of moving my account as i need a bank who care. "
Customer_1147, Bad Customer Service ," I was with BANK_NAME number of years. That was bad enough, they actually caused stress with insurance that I didn't need or want. But on customer service, there is no end to the ignorant and rude counter staff. A standing order failed between my bank and account at BANK_NAME. Something to do with number of digits in the sort code. (But now having to transfer the moneys prehistoricly). I was greeted by a counter assistant quite abruptly, refused to put an identifier on the transaction. Then very irate refused to transfer. Must have been beneath her abilities but in a busy bank with many people. Told me it wasn't their fault that the standing order was wrong, speaking over me there's nothing wrong with the account"" Told me she would get someone to explain. She didn't"
Customer_1148, £250 limit !!!! ," I went and opened a new account at the BANK_NAME .mobile banking is an important aspect and what I use all the time...after getting it all set up I found that the maximum amount I can pay or transfer is £250!!!ABSOLUTELY USELESS WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. lm going back to BANK_NAME ,sensible online banking. "
Customer_1149, incorrect informaton ," I went online to set up a direct debit where is says you have to be over the age of 16 (i am 17 years of age), still though for some reason it would let me set one up. i decided to call their help line where they proceeded to tell me i have to be over 18, i informed the lady it said 16 on the website but she didn't seem to care about that. she was very rude and talked down to me, they still haven't corrected their error online. i am now going to be changing my banking to Halifax as they are a much better bank and i think BANK_NAME should really learn a few things from them. when i told the lady (rude girl) i was changing because how unorganized and rude she was she didn't care so obviously have no respect for their customers, i work in an environment where i have to give customer service and you should ALWAYS make every customer feel like you really want them to stay with your company and that they are important i urge everyone to swap banks to anyone else as i know anyone would be a hell of a lot better. wish i knew the name of that lady (rude girl) so i could name and shame the poor customer service and rude attitude. "
Customer_1150, Totally disgusted!! ," I went to BANK_NAME at Washwood Heath branch to pay a cheque in for my husband.I asked the lady for a receipt to prove I have paid the money in and she called me a Fraudster in front of everyone and what I have been doing the past 4 years paying in his cheque is classed as fraud????I said well for the past 4 years iv been ok paying it in and no one has ever called me a fraudster as I'm only paying in not with drawing money.She said the members of staff who has aloud me to pay money in to someone's else's account need reporting, so she wasn't happy when I mentioned she's served me in the past on numerous occasions.To have a receipt to prove iv paid the money in I needed to call my husband and get his account details, to which she already had them in front of her.Totally disgusted by her customer service, iv never been made to feel so bad by any bank before!And all I was doing was paying in a cheque! "
Customer_1151, waste of space , I went to open an account with BANK_NAME did it online then went into branch to show documentation I then started receiving relevant emails texts ect ect  then the welcome letter card and pin. Trying to activate my card I went into the branch for them to turn round and say the bank has decided to close the account no reasons why or any information was given to see why it was closed Utterly pissed of with BANK_NAME Never never use BANK_NAME bank that's my advice to anyone 
Customer_1152, Worst experience EVER! NEVER go with BANK_NAME! ," I went to work abroad for 2 years in Dubai. Obviously I did not use my BANK_NAME account to pay money into, I used a foreign account. I returned to the UK 2 weeks ago as I have employment. I called BANK_NAME to see if my account was still active. They said yes, so I asked for New card and pin number to be sent out to me. The card arrived, but 2 weeks later I still have no pin number...SO...I need to purchase a new vehicle for commuting to and from work. I called BANK_NAME and asked them CLEARLY If i have £2000 transferred into my account after 2 years of not using the account so I am able to purchase a vehicle"
Customer_1153, BANK_NAME easily betrays its customers! ," I wish I had never set foot in a BANK_NAME branch!After banking with this lot for 8 years, they suddenly decided to terminate all my accounts with no obvious reason. This was despite my statements were always paid on time in full and I always had a chunky amount in my saving account. They not only haven't bothered to provide a reason for this absurd act, but they have also totally denied me any rights of appeal to this stupid decision! They always talk about customer loyalty!!! what about their own organisation not betraying their customers trust!Anyways, fortunately I already have accounts with with another bank (a respectful one!) and their service is much better. BANK_NAME service was always crap anyway! "
Customer_1154, Outstanding mortgage application service ," I would like to give my special thanks to Abid and Darren from BANK_NAME branch based in Spring Gardens Manchester for the mortgage application service I received today. I am a first time buyer and originally applied for a mortgage with another high street bank. After two weeks I was disappointed with their lack of communication which has put my mortgage application in jeopardy. I then decided to walk into BANK_NAME branch to make mortgage application enquiries where I was met by Abid who grasped my story quickly, took me through Agreement in Principle and booked me in for a Mortgage Application two days later. Mortgage application with Darren was as robust and fast and decision usually takes a couple of days. It is simply an exceptional and outstanding service I received from BANK_NAME employees! Thank you very much for being so professional. It really makes a difference. "
Customer_1155, Has to be the worst bank for business!! ," I would need a few pages to write my real review! In a nutshell, BANK_NAME banking for business is full of useless 'relationship managers' who do nothing for you!!! You are simply a number for them!!BANK_NAME Bank is the future!!! I'm changing very soon. "
Customer_1156, Like long waiting time on the phone and apathy? This is a bank for you! ," I write this review while being on the phone with BANK_NAME Business bank.Not difficult as you WILL spend hours trying to speak to someone using their voice prompts. At present, 26 minutes and counting.Long and short, we asked for an additional debit card for our limited company. I am the company secretary, so nothing out the ordinary here. We requested this 3 weeks weeks ago.1/ First, i had to go to the branch just to obtain the forms to fill in. No one was able to tell me if/how to download them from the Internet. That is helpful banking. Mailed the forms to NW by post hoping to see a new debit card materialise through the post, as I was told to expect.2/  Three weeks down the line, on the 7 Nov, no news from NWest whatsoever. We call. Go through their inane telephone system. Nice lady tries to help: yes, it looks like the business team received but something seems to be missing, may be a signature, in our application. Ehhhh? What about giving a quick phone call to your valued customer? 3/ Today, call from the business team: they believe we are sole trader (we became a limited over 10 years ago, have told so to the NW team when we took the time to collect the forms in person from their branch, this tells you how well knows us and how close they are from their clients.4/ Every time someones at NW feels they are not the person you need to talk to, what do they do? Get the right person at NW and kindly transfer you to them after wishing you a pleasant day? No, you are reinjected directly into the same hellish NW telephone system and hope that next time, you get someone showing a bit more willing. I have done this loop of death 3 times. No one takes ownership. When you tell them their record-keeping are woefully inadequate, the answer is bordering on the it is your fault"". 10 years without a phone call for a simple update"
Customer_1157, Simply the worst. ," I wrote a full-on review which turned out to be closer to war and peace, so decided to re-write it. Here's the bullet-point edition:1. Forced me onto accounts I didn't need or want at 18 years old, didn't make me aware of cheaper alternatives, didn't allow my parents to come in and look over T's and C's despite my request to as I didn't really know what I was doing;2. Few years later I tried applying for a graduate loan to consolidate, on-line system ballsed up, second application was rejected, when phoning 'customer services' was told Yeah"
Customer_1158, I’ve been trying to open a bank account … , I’ve been trying to open a bank account since December. I have tried to open three bank accounts with BANK_NAME. 2 for business and 1 for private use. Two of the accounts were opened in a relatively short time. The third one has been a total nightmare. The new business team do not have a clue as to what they are doing. They give a totally different response every time I call. Each department even the complaints department say a different story to the next. It’s the worst customer service I have with banks in over 30 years of doing business. Totally under trained staff. Haven’t got a clue what they are doing. Problem still not resolved. I will be forced to go to another bank. It’s like dealing with a mad house. 
Customer_1159, (Personal&Business Acc) Truly horrendous service. How are BANK_NAME even in business?! ," I'd been a customer for around eleven years with BANK_NAME and besides some terrible student account management ten years ago, always had a pretty good standing with the bank, regular wages, standing order payments for bills, etc. Up until recently I'd had a relatively good time with BANK_NAME, service-wse, but around 1.5 years ago the service failed on a number of fronts. The trigger for this was opening a business account wherein things changed significantly in the service for both personal and business banking affairs. BANK_NAME seem to treat business queries with personal finance factors (even for a Limited company, where the entities are entirely separate), and the same happens in reverse; personal banking queries are dealt with by the business banking team, who know absolutely nothing about personal banking - neither team seems to know about the other, how they operate or what processes are in place for handling even basic queries - it is literally like speaking different languages when speaking with different teams. The resulting chaos of this approach means that there is unrivalled levels of confusion internally about who to speak with, which teams are open/closed and up until what time, information about the service, complaints procedure; basically consistent misinformation at every step. Often even just getting through to speak to the relevant person has been really difficult. To elaborate more here, I'd say less than 33% of the time I've been able to get accurate answers to basic questions, due to not being able to speak with my account handler. Other employees simply do not help, they only seem to 'care' about their own dedicated accounts. In the minority of cases where I did manage to fluently speak to the account handler (I've noticed the service drops even further when it gets close to 5pm, when their business team 'clocks off'...), I found her to be highly unprofessional, rude, uninformed and made quite serious, critical errors when handling the accounts (critical here meaning, when I closed one account, they pro-actively told me that the other account would be active and fully unaffected (as you'd expect), but then literally a few DAYS before the account was closing, having trusted my own gut from experience that they'd probably misinformed me here, they ratified my thoughts and told me the opposite...that actually the business account would be affected. This resulted in my demanding immediate escalation and rectification). Escalating to the senior manager seemed to make little difference in the service or the general empathy for the mistakes made, but thankfully they eventually agreed to intervene on their own mistake (which even though unquestionable, took some convincing..). The complaints procedure is engineered for disjoint; it's specifically designed to waste peoples time enough so that only the very cream of the complaints crop actually make it through to fruition. Hardly surprising as they would go out of business if they had to fully handle every complaint properly. After withstanding around 15 months of utterly terrible service in late 2014 and 2015, I decided the best thing to do would be to completely move my personal account away from BANK_NAME, to BANK_NAME which I was able to do in a surprisingly short space of time. I had hoped that this would improve the business banking service with BANK_NAME, but unfortunately, this made no difference whatsoever, as in due course the relationship was already soured and the employees retained poor service to the business. I would love for BANK_NAME to take time to listen to and reflect fully on ALL of the calls I've made in the past six or so months (the duration of the main mess they've caused), but the only way BANK_NAME will do this would be if a complaint is seen through, the process for which is so convoluted and time consuming that it's literally not worth any further of my time. That is of course, if you can get through the complains team (one recent occasion I held for 45 minutes only to be told the department was shut). I'll now be moving the business account elsewhere too, out of principle and with hopes of much better service with another bank. In short, BANK_NAME might be 'OK' if you need menial personal-account interaction, however if you need any level of complexity in your banking, for example a mortgage, additional account and especially if you require some business banking of any kind, I'd strongly recommend shopping around and avoiding BANK_NAME like the plague.I can only assume now that their slogan Helpful banking"" is yet another catastrophic error in judgement of theirs"
Customer_1160, If i could give zero stars i would ," If i could give zero stars i would. sinse opening my account last year i have been unable to access any part of my account including my pin, online details and had no card reader despite numerous attempts to change my address. Due to work arrangements i am unable to go to branch which makes things beyond difficult dealing with BANK_NAME. over the bank holiday i have had absolutely no access to my money. not even online. Staff over the phone haven't been exactly helpful so all in all i am absolutely disgusted and will be closing my account. "
Customer_1161, AWFUL DONT CARE ABOUT YOU AT ALL ," If I could move banks I would. I changed from HSBC to BANK_NAME five years ago and it went from bad to worse. Interest charges came out of my account under NET ADJ. I had no idea what this was so asked BANK_NAME chat. Gurrender took a very long time to respond to my query and stated he didn't have access to see the issue. I explained it all to him and he palmed me off to the phoneline. If I wanted to speak to them I would have contacted them first.To wrap it up; poor knowledge of charges BANK_NAME create, poor typer, unable or at least not willing to help. Very disappointing service. "
Customer_1162, Theives and liars ," If I were you I would stay well away from this bank they are criminals in suits!. Money has been going missing from my account every time I call it's apparently pending transactions"" even when there is nothing to lend as the account hasn't been used! "
Customer_1163, Poor service bank ," If there got 0 start I definitely give 0 star, this is about aberdeen BANK_NAME bank, I imagine this definately really poor bank, never can do like what they said. The staff in the bank even doen’t Have commen sense. I applied the current account online, then I got the letter from here said let me take the provisional driving licence and address approvement to the branch. Then I did, but the staff said like stupid. Said your driving licence’ s address is different to the the one you applied and also letter’s title is mrs but the driving licence says ms. I think ID identification is Just identification. Why needs the address is same. Why they still need address approvement. Ms and mrs is the common sense. They are the same think. Really stupid staff. I think this is why there is very quiet in the bank. Some staff like this. Won’t be busy any more. Definately won’t use and or introduce to my any friends and relitives. Poor service bank. "
Customer_1164, If there was a zero star option they … ," If there was a zero star option they would be receiving this. I have had persisting troubles with BANK_NAME, and have received very unfriendly and unhelpful advice every-time that I have approached them. I would strongly recommend that nobody chooses this bank, as they are useless and their customer service is absolutely appalling. I am very disgusted with BANK_NAME. "
Customer_1165, They steel on a massive scale as do all banks , If you are ever going to pay money use PayPal because when you are defrauded and have 100% evidence I e emails with company admitting having your money BANK_NAME will not do a thing to recover for you NOT A THING !!!!!PayPal will refund you straight away no fuss and take the problem on them selfs 
Customer_1166, BANK_NAME ," If you are thinking of opening an account with BANK_NAME, don't bother their customer service is worse than appalling.  I have banked with them for over 23 years and changed a single account to a joint account, but then split up with my husband who tried to get a fraud case opened against me, because I stopped his direct debits, as a result BANK_NAME froze the joint account, but I was lucky enough to open another account in just my name and transferred all the money in the joint account to my sole account as well as all the direct debits.  There was no fraud but the bank insisted the no operations marker stayed.  I requested to have  my husband's name taken off the joint account but BANK_NAME wouldn't budge I was told so many different things and it just got worse when last October nearly a year after I opened the sole account in just my name, I was unable to use any online banking or telephone banking which the customer service at first said there was no reason why, then they told me in a letter that it was because of the joint account being frozen.  When I got the ombudsman involved they said that I was not enrolled in online banking,  that I should re register and and call them if I encountered any problems, which I did but and  surprise, surprise I was unable to access the online banking.  I did as they also said and called customer service and was on the phone for over 20 minutes to be told that they needed to call me back the next day, but didn't call me back until 2 days later to tell me that the reason I couldn't access the online banking was because of the joint account being frozen, I was then put through to a customer service manager, who accepted that it wasn't acceptable and would look into it again for me.  Now all the way up to this point I had assumed that everything that BANK_NAME had done was a legal requirement.   BANK_NAME finally admitted that there was restrictions on my online banking because of the joint account being frozen despite previously saying there were no restrictions, and they are now saying that I need to get a new customer number which according to them is the reason for the restrictions however I don't accept that, because I was using the sole account for nearly a year before there was any problem, and BANK_NAME have so far  not answered why this is the case.  Their solution is for me to close the account that is just in my name, and open a new one to get a new customer number, but I have refused because I do not see why I should do that, they cocked up, it is they who should fix it, but they are refusing.  Now as I have said earlier I was led to believe that the actions BANK_NAME took were a legal requirement, however that is not the case it's just an internal policy they have and can change if they choose to, and should have done when I provided proof that my husband had acted maliciously by sending them a copy of a letter my solicitor sent to my husband's solicitor complaining about his malicious behaviour and how it had to stop, apparently after receiving that the bank could have taken his name off the joint account because of the restrictions they have placed on my sole account, but BANK_NAME are refusing to do it even after all the mistakes they have clearly made throughout this whole process, they didn't even provide any sort of terms and conditions to back up their claim, until the Ombudsban got involved.  I have even threatened to close my sole account and go to another bank, however they have got me over a barrel, because my account is overdrawn and they will want their money back.  I do not see how opening another account is going to solve this to just have the same problems all over again, of transferring direct debits and arguing with them to get an overdraft because transferring direct debits is supposed to be easy, but was not with them, and then the problems will start all over again.  If I could I would tell them to shove their accounts up their backsides and go elsewhere then I would, but they will want their money back and I need to be able to buy my husband out of our home so I can't do anything until that has been sorted out, but BANK_NAME are not the bank they claim to be, and I would not recommend them to anyone, because they are worse than useless. "
Customer_1167, Worst Customer Service not just in banking but in the world ," If you want a bank that will fine you regularly BANK_NAME would be the best bank in the world. Their online banking software does not give you live data so you cant check you balance as its not live data, they fine you for just about everything, and when you complain the complaints department get irate with you and in the last circumstance I called they hung up on me when I was asking for advice on what can I do more to stay on top of my finances. Honestly BANK_NAME used to be good but they have become the worst bank in the country if not the world. Just a bunch of greedy sod's who treat you like a balance sheet and take"
Customer_1168, Horrible Student Account Application Proccess: ," I'm in my second year at university and due to living expenses and things, I decided to open a student account for the overdraft facility as an emergency option. I applied online but the form to fill was just so crunched together and was horrible to try and read, but once I got through that, I had to wait just short of a week to receive a letter asking me to send in documents from the list on 'Table C' and there was no table c included in the letter, but I had my university print off a letter to prove I was a student and I sent it to them, just short of another week letter, I got the document back saying they were looking into things. And well a few days after that (today) I received one saying my application was rejected.I can't understand why I was rejected. I have good credit history with other banks and credit cards, always paid my bills on time. But there's no communication on why I was rejected. I'm not complaining about the rejection as such, I'm complaining about the lengthily time it took to get to this point. I mean why all letters? Why not be with the modern times and send an email? If I'd have been happy with BANK_NAME then I was contemplating moving my other accounts over to them but I think I'll stay put for now.. "
Customer_1169, Tired ," I'm really tired of BANK_NAME I've been with this bank for couple of years now and they charge me every single month saying I've gone over my limit when half of the time there's nothing in my account.I get money in my account onces every month and something the charge me £40,£50,£90 I've got two children to look after and what gets me the most with them is that even if your account is in -  they still apply there charges.I'm not happy and I will be looking for a bank that can meet my needs. "
Customer_1170, Incompetent nonsense ," I'm writing this while I await a password prompt from BANK_NAME. I've been a customer for 50 years and have never previously had anything but good service. It feels as if they have outsourced all the important bits and forgotten to leave anyone in charge of logic and competence.We elected more than a month ago to switch to their 'Reward' account, and requested they substitute our existing credit cards with the 'Reward' variety. I'm so confused that I can't even begin to tell TrustPilot readers what has happened to us.My password prompt has still not emerged after 30 minutes.## It's now 40 hours (26/07/2016 22:57) and still no password prompt. "
Customer_1171, Impossible to make a complaint , Impossible to make a complaint. They direct you to an online form but where it says  ‘What does your complaint relate to? *’ there are no options on the list to select and the form refuses to be submitted.I tried calling them instead only to find out later a £15 call charge on my phone bill! Turns out that their helpline number is non-geographic! The customer service advisor didn't tell me that while he was nattering away otherwise I'd have asked for a call back. 
Customer_1172, impossible to speak to customer … , impossible to speak to customer services at any time over the phone last 2 times have just given up after about 60-90 minutes holding no excuse 
Customer_1173," Friendly employees, and absolutely no ability to help you "," In a lot of ways BANK_NAME is a stereotypical bank.  You ask for something seemingly mundane, they put you on hold and then declare they can't do it. There is no flexibility, the friendly employee's commiserate with you and say I'm sorry we can't do that"
Customer_1174, Internet banking never works. , Internet banking never works. 
Customer_1175, it  is the worst bank I have ever used ," it  is the worst bank I have ever used. I got locked out of my account and had to wait 5 weeks for them to evenn do anything other than tell me to wait, one week later, they still havent done anything. "
Customer_1176, No fair , It discriminate against people. 
Customer_1177," 3 months to get a card, been running my business on my personal credit card!!! ", It has taken 3 months to get a new card sent out for my business bank account. I've just phoned them today for the 4th time and was asked to fill out a new card application form!!!!! I HAVE A BUSINESS ACCOUNT WITH YOU AND NO DEBIT CARD - how am I expected to make purchases?? Any way was on the phone for 28 mins trying to resolve only to be cut off. I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall. If you'd like to run a business without spending the majority of your time on the phone to your bank I'd suggest going with someone other than BANK_NAME 
Customer_1178, it is a great bank-friendly people , it is a great bank-friendly people 
Customer_1179, It is as if the staff are bent on NOT … ," It is as if the staff are bent on NOT helping you. BANK_NAME specifically, Headington - Oxford. I visited thrice only to be dismissed each time, with requests of documents; which is absolutely ok in this day and age of theft and fraud. However, even upon bringing required, original, authentic documents, they still didn't offer me the service- a name change for my account. I felt discriminated against as the staff member scrutinised my documents over and over, consulted the manager and finally never helped me anyway- despite having an original document. So closed the account ASAP and moved service elsewhere.  Unkindness never pays. Worst bank service ever experienced. "
Customer_1180, Dismal customer experience , It seems unlikely to me that any of the senior management team at BANK_NAME ever try to contact there own bank via the phone or via internet like their customers.  In fact they may have wisely decided that they're better off banking elsewhere.They should all be made to open accounts with First Direct to get an understanding of how a proper telephone/online banking operation actually works! 
Customer_1181, Its really secure , Its really secure. I find that its a bit of a problem checking my balance. I am not used to the app so I am not sure if it does show you your balance and it doesn't state weather you can see it or not 
Customer_1182, poor quaility of service , iv been with BANK_NAME for three years and I have had nothing but a bad experience. first I was misold a packaged account that was no good at all to me. then when I made a complaint I was told it would be dealt with within the ten days authorized to do so still 42 days down the line no response and when I phone up they just fob me off or hang up. total joke of a customer service and would not recommend anyone to use this bank.unacceptable from a customers point of view 
Customer_1183, Top Service from a Top Bank ," I've banked with BANK_NAME since I was 14 and i've always found their service to be great. Only once or twice have I had a poor experience, but which company doesn't? Their student account is top class compared to what other banks have to offer and from what i've looked at their Graduate account is too. I used to hold my ISA savings with them but sadly they don't offer competitive saving rates so I moved to another provider. Otherwise a top service from what I think is one of the high streets best banks. "
Customer_1184, BANK_NAME / ROBBING F##KERS ," I've been banking BANK_NAME for over 10 years and Yes in that time I have missed the odd direct debit payment.I've been using my bank account as normal making transfers, payments with my card etc etc... Until yesterday (06/06/14) when I used my card at a ATM and it declined.After calling the HELPLINE and the waiting for 2 hours for the relevant department to call me back.They then tell me that they are closing my account..!!! AND WILL GIVE ME NO REASON.Therefore I cant withdraw any money. So now I have no access to MY MONEY. I have no overdraft with the bank, I'm not overdrawn and I don't owe the bank any money.They told me to get access to my money I need to wait for an email which will take upto 4 days..!!!!! I've then to print off a letter sign it and POST IT back.I'll have to wait around 7-10 days to get MY OWN MONEY OUT.Friday for me like many people is food shopping night.I'm unable to buy food, can't put fuel in my car and I can't get to work therefore I've had to call in sick for work.I don't get sick pay so now I will lose pay also.I can't eat and I cant work all because BANK_NAME won't allow me to have access to my OWN MONEY....I really don't know what I can do, a whole week to come without food....Surely this cant be allowed..!!!!GOOGLE BANK_NAME CLOSING MY ACCOUNT and you'll see there are thousands of othersNEVER EVER BANK WITH BANK_NAME/RBS. "
Customer_1185," Incredibly understanding, very helpful "," I've been banking with BANK_NAME for years and years and always found them fine, easy to get hold of when needed and great customer service, but today really stood out. I was paranoid that there had been fraudulent activity on my account as I'm due a new bank card, and had an e-receipt from a well known high street retailer for a card number that isn't my current one. Rang the retailer, they were useless, so I popped to my local BANK_NAME branch in Covent Garden. I spoke to a lady who I believe is the manager who really set my mind at ease, checking my transactions and even giving me the last 4 digits of my new card number so that if I find any transactions made by that card before it arrives with me, I know they are fraudulent. She also cancelled a card that I was sent mistakenly due to some sort of admin error caused by me changing account type when I became a student to prevent that ever becoming an issue. Overall very chuffed with them, don't see why I'd ever move to bank anywhere else! "
Customer_1186, I've been banking with BANK_NAME my whole … , I've been banking with BANK_NAME my whole life and it's just a horrible experience of constant incompetence. Do not open an account with BANK_NAME ever.

Resisted changing but realise that the customer service is so shocking now that it's time to move.How do they always have 'higher than expected call volumes ' no matter when you phone.

Customer_1189, Customer Service is an Absolute Joke ," I've been with BANK_NAME for 15 years, never had a problem, but over the past few months have experienced such awful customer service I'm now going to switch.If you're thinking of banking with them: don't. They are utterly incompetent.I tried to open a joint bank account (you'd think a simple enough task). We went into the bank, was introduced to a Senior Banking Advisor who gave us an impressive-sounding speech about how the bank were going back to basics"" and ""listening to our customers' needs is key"". Set up the account"
Customer_1190, Good luck if you're a victim of fraud ," I've been with BANK_NAME for 20 years. In September, three fraud transactions hit my account; two were refunded immediately (currency), one (a takeaway delivery!) was not. Because I'd used the online retailer before, it was considered a 'retail dispute' and BANK_NAME could only contact the retailer for information via their bank.That's after they wrote to me to tell me that my Visa Secure password had been re-set, and the only person who could possibly have access to the information required to re-set it would be me; we suggest you carefully check your transactions madam. Three and a half months later, I discover a major flaw in Visa's systems. To re-set the password, you need four pieces of information, three of which are available on the debit card itself (so, viewable on any cloned card), the last is your date of birth, which apparently is publicly available information - I am not sure how, perhaps via council tax records. Firstly I didn't appreciate being accused of making up fraud transactions or of frankly being too stupid to know how I'm spending money, and secondly, BANK_NAME appear to be providing customers with a debit card that's as easy as pie to hack... which is nice. Of course, they're not going to openly admit this to you. No, Visa is SECURE. Nonsense is it. All that Visa need to do is to add in a secret question or two into their password re-set system to resolve this problem. Anyway, I must've written to this guy dealing with my case five times in four months. Despite threatening to report them to the banking ombudsan and that I'd close my account if the money wasn't refunded by a date in December (at the 3.5 month point here - please note that when they did write to me, I was told it would take up to six weeks), I had NOTHING back from him and no credit.Finally, at the beginning of January, I filled in an online complaint form detailing my displeasure at their customer service and complete lack of keeping me up to date and not responding to my letters. I received a refund to my account a day later. On the complaint, I asked to be compensated. I've spent approx 10 hours writing to this guy. Anyway, no compensation. The latest letter tells me that my enquiry has been submitted to the retailer's bank in line with membership of Visa International. So - hang on - they've actually only JUST submitted the enquiry, after four months?Enough is enough. The final step in this saga will be to write back to the Senior Bank Officer (not the same guy) stating my dissatisfaction, and I will copy the banking ombudsman on the entire correspondent chain too. I've already started looking into other banking providers.Now, this may seem like extreme action for a relatively small amount (£69.00) - but consider this: 1) I've been a customer for 20 years;  2) I got lucky - someone else is going to be very unlucky with a 'retailer dispute' that could cost them to lose thousands from their account until BANK_NAME can be bothered to actually do something about it (any website you have EVER used would be a 'retailer dispute', and I assume that also applies to any shop you've ever physically visited too). Imagine waiting six weeks, or four months as I have, to have a substantial amount of money put back in your account? And finally, all of their online blurb states that fraud transactions will be refunded immediately. Well, hey, this IS fraud, it's just that BANK_NAME choose to name this a different type of fraud and therefore don't apply the same terms to it - in complete contradiction to their customer charter. The cost of fraud is factored into our bank charges, loan rates, mortgage rates, etc etc. So, you do pay in advance for a service which is meant to give you your money back immediately in fraud cases. Unacceptable BANK_NAME. I'm going to go somewhere with better, ethical customer service, and hopefully who also provide more secure debit cards than Visa with its easily hackable level of security. "
Customer_1191, Good bank & customer service ," Ive been with BANK_NAME for 9+ Year. Fast bank transfers, apple pay, emergency cash etc. good customer service if you have a problem. Only reason for the 5th star missing is purely because when you pay contact less (might not be BANK_NAME themselves at fault) some times the contact less payment can be taken up to 3-5 days later which can give you a false available balance. "
Customer_1192, Some nice staff but bank itself is terrible ," I've been with this bank 10 years, and will be finally closing within the next month. High fees, overdrafts with high interest suddenly changed, being treated like a criminal when I had to leave the country for a couple of months. Generally an awful bank with a terrible ethical score. Customer service is not great, the people are nice but they don't have enough staff. I was waiting to be connected for 26 minutes and as soon as they answered they hung up on me - imagine my frustration! In this day and age with Nationwide leading the way ethically and First Direct excelling at customer service pitiful BANK_NAME really need to up their game. However, it'll be too late for me :) "
Customer_1193, Slowww account , I've been with this bank for a while now but their system is ridiculously slowww.Over the weekends its like it doesn't even work. You don't see your balance till about late Monday or even Tuesday 
Customer_1194, Closing a great branch in Wellington Somerset , I've had good services for over the 50 plus years with BANK_NAME (formerly National Provincial)... but not happy with them closing a great branch in Wellington...so it's time for me to find a new bank I think. The branch is important to the town and is well used so it's a great shame and BANK_NAME will loose many customers to our two remaining town banks. 
Customer_1195, Wonderful , I've just rang BANK_NAME to order a new debit card as mine snapped in half. I spoke to a young lady called Hameed (I hope I have spelt her name correctly) she was an absolute delight to speak to and extremely helpful and efficient. We had a lovely chat in between her sorting my problem out and genuinely put a smile on my face! She seems very positive and competent at her job; with a professional yet relaxed and friendly approach. 
Customer_1196, The complaints department is atrocious ," I've never had such a terrible experience with a bank. They closed our bank account without adequate authority and transferred the money out of it. Trying to get it back is a nightmare. The closing team admitted they had made a mistake and were very helpful - but they had to transfer it to the complaints department to do anything.The complaints department never answer the phone within 15 minutes and then cut you off. The chat was equally frustrating. Basically, nobody can do anything at all with any speed. It takes them 10 working days to respond to the complaint. This doesn't mean doing anything, the representative has hastened to add, It just means that they will acknowledge the complaint. They cannot give any timescale and in the meantime, it leaves us without any bank account and without our money. Is anyone managing this bank??? Do they have any understanding of customer service whatsoever? "
Customer_1197, Don't try opening an account! ," I've tried to open a business account which has been so ridiculous,  it's untrue. The communication is zero. Hard to find telephone numbers which when you use, find yourself hanging for ages. Up to an hour on one occasion. They just don't care. People forgetting to call me back, no update on progress. No one knows what's going on. They seriously have issues. The same application at Santander took 1 hour, over the phone and opened. I rarely complain but BANK_NAME really are worth it. Awful! "
Customer_1198, I've tried to switch my joint account … ," I've tried to switch my joint account to BANK_NAME under the £125 incentive scheme. They have asked my partner and I to upload copies of our passport id. They accepted my partner's photo id (which wasn't that clear) but mine which I've done on a clearer resolution they keep on rejecting! I rang customer services and they said take the passport into your local branch. I did and a very unhelpful woman (Weymouth branch) said they couldn't do anything about it! Something about they couldn't access me on the system (she didn't even try).So  customer services apparently sent me on a wild goose chase. The woman in the bank did nothing to encourage new customers...she couldn't have cared 2 hoots! I use to be a member of BANK_NAME several years ago, in fact I was a customer for over 20 years. The customer service has definitely gone downhill. My passport photo is apparently good enough for the government and passport control but not for BANK_NAME! "
Customer_1199, Joined BANK_NAME in January attracted by… ," Joined BANK_NAME in January attracted by their 125£ bonus given to new customers that switch bank and stay.They ask for a minimum monthly pay in of 1500£ to join the Reward Program, and I deposited my salary.Then, when it comes to pay my rent, it turns out that I cannot setup a payment to without a card reader that takes 7-10 days to get shipped.So basically I cannot have access to MY money in the next 7-10 days!!!!Oh, wait.. MAYBE I can, in a branch, paying a 23£ (!!!!!!) fee.I regret to have joined, and since I cannot pay my rent, I have a big problem. "
Customer_1200, Thinking of Banking with BANK_NAME? ," Just don't. Maybe you are thinking... yeah, its got terrible reviews... but that branch is really close to my apartment, or my work has a special deal with them... JUST DON'T. The customer service is terrible, their systems are archaic, their security measures are draconian... I've been trying to wire out my money since JANUARY 2015 and still have not had any success. I'll keep trying, but would highly recommend using ANY other bank. "
Customer_1201, Just had a survey valuation for my … , Just had a survey valuation for my buyers. BANK_NAME used bramleys. I aired my concerns with my estate agents when I knew they were using bramleys as they are notorious for undervaluing and they have  proved me right. They undervalued my house as expected. After further investigations I find BANK_NAME consistently undervalue for mortgage purposes. This should be illegal but they are getting away with it. I am looking into taking legal action for my losses. BANK_NAME say they do 95% mortgages but it is at the expense of the sellers because they undervalue your home to give themselves a comfort blanket. CORRUPT 
Customer_1202, After hours telephone banking for business - be prepared to wait.. , Just spent 22 minutes waiting for BANK_NAME to answer the phone at 11PM. Finally got through and call handled well by experienced advisor. But 11PM is hardly the busiest time of day. Also tried at 4PM and gave up after 12 minutes - c'mon BANK_NAME we need good service. 
Customer_1203, Just the worst banking experience ever… ," Just the worst banking experience ever after switching my current account to BANK_NAME, by far the worst financial experience. Customer support are unhelpful and just insist that it's my own fault, do yourself a favour and stay away. "
Customer_1204, Just the worst customer service ," Just the worst customer service. I've had accounts with them since I was a child and my mum set me up my first account. But they are just terrible. Stupid supposed misunderstandings, pointless 'I'm sorrys' with no explanation for how they can get such basic things wrong, staff are nice but useless. After 20 years I'm leaving. Good riddance. "
Customer_1205, keep getting told i do not have an online or telephone banking service. ," keep getting told i do not have an online or telephone banking service. If that were true, how am i logged in via the mobile app? "
Customer_1206, Rude! Do not open a child's account if you do not share the same last name. ," Last month I tried to open a savings account for my 10 year old daughter. I had previously opened an account for my 14 year old daughter without any problems. I am not a customer but for various reasons this is the bank we choose. My daughter and I went equipped with a passport for her and a passport, driving licence, several bills and a credit card for me to prove identity. Everything went well until the woman we were dealing with had to get the final authorisation from her supervisor. This woman came into the room and told me I had to prove I was my daughter's mother as i did not share the same surname as her. I felt insulted but agreed that I would return the next day with my daughter's birth certificate (you cannot get a passport without a birth certificate and as the passport has  a photo I thought that this would be enough.)The next day, I handed over the certificate (which incidentally does not include details of parents) and I asked for a copy of the company policy that asked for this identification. It was duly copied and the woman returned and gave me a piece of A4 paper with a bullet point and three lines on it showing the company policy. I asked why I had to prove my relationship with my daughter and I was told the following:- I do not have the same last name as her but my husband could open the account for her without any problem. I pointed out that on this basis so could his brother, his father and his sister-in-law. - She said she did not share a last name with her husband but they had given their children both their last names to avoid this confusion. Perhaps I should do the same!- It is to protect everyone from money laundering and terrorism. I asked if my daughter looked like a terrorist and if the £10 a month I was going to put into a Young Savers Account would be sufficient to fund a bombing cell.To be fair, I made a complaint and received an apology from the bank. However, it still really hurts that I had to prove that I was my daughter's mother, even though I don't think I have done that, surely only a DNA test could prove that. I do wish that I had not started the process. "
Customer_1207, I can't fault them! ," Let's be honest, you won't get many people who go online, to write a positive review about an internet company, phoneline company, and banks! As many people just don't. Seeing alot of negative reviews below, maybe I'm just one of the lucky ones!Few months back, I had an authorised payment processed by a hotel I did not confirm on Booking.com. BANK_NAME immediately refunded me the money back into my account, within a few days.Today, an atm machine short changed me £40, and again, BANK_NAME told me they will refund me back within one workday day, no quarrels, hassle free! I couldn't fault them since my time with them. And I find their mobile app the best bank app. "
Customer_1208, Frustratingly bad service ," Like many people who have reviewed here, I would give this bank no stars if possible. My husband has been a loyal BANK_NAME customer since he was a child. (he is now 45) He pays annually to have their private banking service and when I first met him he thought he was getting a good service from them until I pointed out that for home insurance they were charging him double what he could get elsewhere. When challenged on this they brought the price down to closer what we could get elsewhere and said their better prices were only for new customers! This obviously means that once they have snared you as a customer they treat you badly and just expect you to stay with them, but new customers get treated better.We then tried to get a second mortgage with them, we already had one on another property, and because we pay for their private banking service we were told we would get a response back quickly from their mortgage dept. Well, we waited two weeks to hear back with numerous phone calls every day to them to see if we could get an update. If this is their fast service for paying clients God help everyone else.Now a few years have passed and we wanted to port our mortgage onto another property that has a shared water supply with the house next door. It is in rural North Devon and this type of water supply is usual and SWW even have a dedicated web page for neighbours who share water. Anyhow, we are a day away from exchange and BANK_NAME have told us they won't accept a shared water supply, even though it is recognised by SWW & valuers insist it doesn't impact the price of the property. They want us to put in a separate water supply, and because the nearest water meter is over a mile away it will cost £15,000 to do. Are they crazy!!! We have a water supply that works perfectly well, all deeds and agreements are in place with the house next door so what is their problem? We have escalated our complaint and their 'fast service' for private customers has so far taken 10 days for them to make a decision on it. We know it has been sitting on someones desk for a while now as we have been told they have it, but no one is dealing with it, even though they have been told we are going to be homeless in 14 days if we can't exchange and the chain above us is going to collapse imminently. Their service is disgraceful and for that reason we will be taking our bank accounts and 30 year history with the bank and going somewhere else. Shame on you BANK_NAME! "
Customer_1209, not disabled friendly at all! ," Long story to tell but after I got ill they completely messed up with my account until it was closed suddenly, and I have found out when I was supposed to pay for medical treatments. No correct information, personnel not trained correctly, no idea who caused this but after I have been a customer for 17 years.I got a refund but frankly after such a long time I wasn't expecting to have to look for a different bank in my condition.This is disgraceful. "
Customer_1210, Poor! , Love the app and have been banking with them for about 7 years but i am now fed up.Recently sent a payment to a closed account i have with them (instead of the new one). The money should have bounced back but it hasn't. i have now made 2 visits to store and 3 calls of almost 30mins each to try to sort it and have just been passed around with incorrect information. I finally got to the correct team and apparently i have to write them a letter to be able to get the money back......This is a company that is meant to pride itself on its digital/mobile tech and apparently i can't send them emails/texts/talk to people over the phone or in store. It really feels ridiculous! The money came from my Santander account and they have been super helpful and i have all the details but BANK_NAME won't send back my payment. 
Customer_1211, WORST BANK EVER! ," Me and my partner wanted to open a business bank account with BANK_NAME, they've been lying to us for two weeks that the account is in process, after many chasing emails and phone calls they declined it. I am so disappointed with that bank, not trustful at all, waste of time and effort. You have to chase them every day until you realise they have only wasted your time!!! DO NOT USE THEM!Terrible customer service, they were rude and seemed they didn't even care! "
Customer_1212, Worse company ever , Missile mislead and have screen shots ect and told wud get call back for compensation and calls reimbursed for 5 pound for 3hrs of phones calls from a mobile and nothing for been missold or mislead and told 4 different things as while ask for email addrress told no email address to attach anything  hope of  company and I'm process of moving banks as not doing it anymore with this company everyone stay away from this company to bank with 
Customer_1213, Most horrible service ever ," Most horrible service ever, rude staff via phone and even in some branches. They claim they are what they are for the security of their clients. No understanding that their approach is extremely rude and unnecessary "
Customer_1214," No BANK_NAME, Saturday is Saturday, not Monday. "," Most of our experience with BANK_NAME has been OK. Staff are usually friendlier than our previous bank. Mobile app is good. Really like the Get Cash feature to use the cash point without a card. However, taking Direct debit and standing order payments that are due on Monday out of our bank account on Saturday is absolutely archaic.  Our main income is paid on a Sunday evening, bus I need director bits coming out on Monday would be covered. I've been told I can go and get cash but how is this helpful if we decide to go out for the day on Sunday? Cannot go to the supermarket to get food that we might run out of.  And heaven forbid there be an emergency in the family we can't even go to the petrol station to fill up  to get to a friend in need. There is also a regular PayPal payments if these come out on the Saturday or Sunday they are declined.  The last time I discussed this with somebody in the branch I was told it is in the small print when you open a bank account, BANK_NAME see Saturday as Monday  and the only way around it is to go to another bank!  I pointed out many times but it's not Monday it is Saturday but that seemed to fall on deaf ears. "
Customer_1215, An absolute nightmare , Most people pay for things over the phone and think nothing of it. But have you ever wondered what would happen if the person you paid took more than you authorised? Well today I found out and lost £800. BANK_NAME will not refund your money unless you can prove you did not authorise the amount taken. Just who is given a receipt over the phone for a service? Disputes take 24 days to sort out assuming you can get the person or company you paid to be honest and declare the amount taken was wrong. My advise is do not ever use your BANK_NAME visa card to pay for anything over the phone no matter what it is. I lost my money. Don't you lose yours!! 
Customer_1216, Deserve no stars absolutely disgusting bank , Most terrible bank and pathetic service. I would never ever recommend anybody to open an account at BANK_NAME. They lie and never keep to their commitments. Terrible bank and worst ever customer service to business customers 
Customer_1217," Poor service, lies, damming impact to my creditors ", My account was placed on stop for no valid reason after 16 hrs in various calls with the many different departments and 11hrs in call waiting still no resolution just constant lies and buck passing do not use go elsewhere 
Customer_1218, my credit file accepted me for a loan … ," my credit file accepted me for a loan they bank confirm by email,mail banking and hard copy but still not received it gone to ombudsman as it say is messaging takes 24 hrs now 9 weeks on.......also offered compensation 1500 still not received BANK_NAME offering very poor service "
Customer_1219, Awful customer service and dangerous processes! Be extremely careful if you order a replacement card! ," My current debit card was expiring soon and I would be travelling when it expires, so I decided to order a replacement card before I travel. I walked into the Camden Town branch, asked for a replacement to be sent to the branch. The manager said it's not possible. I said I would be travelling and don't want the card to be posted to my home (shared house) while I am not around, then she said ok I can have the card posted to the branch (why did she say it was not possible in the first place?!) Then she pointed me to the cashier. I repeated what I said to the cashier, and the cashier ordered my card and said it would be sent to my home address. God! What did I say?? She said I didn't say I wanted it to be sent to the branch, I said I did, then she said she didn't hear and there was nothing she could do. When I said if the card gets lost she would be responsible, she said she would make a note and cancel the card in 24 hours (the system didn't allow her to do it sooner). A couple of days later, I received a text message from BANK_NAME saying my card will be posted to my home address in 24 hours. Apparently the cashier didn't cancel it. Then I called BANK_NAME customer service, explained the situation, and the guy on the phone said the card hadn't been despatched, and he would change the instructions in the system and have the card sent to branch for me to collect. But today, my housemate told me my new BANK_NAME debit card arrived at my HOME ADDRESS. God! Luckily it was her picking up my card while I am away. After all the troubles and mistakes, BANK_NAME still sent my card to my home address, which I had been doing everything I could to avoid! Why they never listened and never did what they promised to do! "
Customer_1220, Terrible!! ," My daughter had her bank card stolen & her bank account was emptied in the space of a couple of hours.She informed BANK_NAME immediately when she realised that her card had been stolen & they were adament they couldn't help her in any way & just told her to call the police.She's a student living 300 miles away from home and was left penniless. I'm sure they could have assisted her in some way, not impressed! - They could have considered offering her a temporary overdraft or at least suggested where she could go for emergency financial advice as she was so far away from home. My family have been customers of BANK_NAME for several years, I think we'll be moving our accounts after this incident! "
Customer_1221, Lost my e-savings account and the money in it ," My e-savings account has vanished from my online banking and NO ONE in BANK_NAME can tell me where it is, neither that my money is safe. I have been calling costumer  and fraud services as well as complain office and they can't tell me anything about that account. The only thing they repeat over and over again is that they can't see any other account that my basic account on my online banking!! that's right! that's why I am calling and looking for help! I am desperate, WHERE ARE MY SAVINGS??? We are not talking anymore about being inefficient, rude or not competent we are talking about the SECURITY of OUR MONEY!The only answer I got is that in 2 weeks time the investigation team (really???? do they need an investigation team to do a simple trace query of my movements???) I will contact me with more details.NO NO I want my online banking to work NOW and I want to know where my money is NOW isn't that a violation of my costumer rights??? VERY VERY upset with BANK_NAME "
Customer_1222, Customer service so bad it's funny ," My first bad experience at BANK_NAME was as a student in Southampton. I went £17 overdrawn and received a letter asking me to come into the bank to discuss the matter. I was a little surprised as other banks were offering free £100 overdrafts to students. So the next day I went into the bank, and had to explain to a manager standing behind a glass plate in-front of everyone else in the branch how I was going to pay my debt. I had savings (with interest) elsewhere so I was able to explain that paying the small balance was fairly straight forward, but this obviously wasn't good enough as I was then severely advised that this would look very bad in the future if I ever needed a loan for something like a car. I was young and not the sort to make a fuss and silently accepted my admonishment. But went back the following day, payed the balance and closed the account.  Vowing never to return.A decade or so later I needed to change some foreign money and just assumed that any high street bank would just do that for anyone coming off the street. Wrong. BANK_NAME in Crawley only provided that service to BANK_NAME customers. Needless to say other high street banks in Crawley were only to happy to help me.My last (and hopefully ever) experience in a BANK_NAME branch (Cambridge) was so awful, by the end I was half expecting a TV camera to appear. We needed to fill out a form for an ISA and queued for a few minutes to then be told we needed to wait to see somebody else. So we waited about ten minutes and eventually a young lady who had been sitting at a desk in-front of us all along, just tapping at a computer with two empty chairs, (we presume for customers to sit in) got up and gave us the form and suggested we take it home and bring it back filled in. But we had come prepared and had all the information required to fill out the form with us. I expected we would be invited to sit in the chairs, maybe offered a pen, but no we were not allowed to sit in the chairs at the lady's desk and she could not provide us with a pen. I don't think the lady saw anybody else after us. So we moved over to the small stand up mini-desks used to fill out the paying in slips and started to fill out the form. Only be told by another member of staff we were in the way and needed to move. So I moved to an out of the way corner sat on the floor and completed the form. At that point another lady who appeared to be more senior appeared, took the form from us and asked if everything had been ok. By this point I was too flabbergasted and amused by the badness of it all to complain.I will try my best not to trouble them with my custom again. "
Customer_1223," Good, Room to Improve "," My first ever bank account was opened with BANK_NAME. Having been to Halifax and bouncing back to BANK_NAME following a struggle with debt and an overdraft, I have been very pleased with their service. The one issue I have is that there is no way of viewing pending transactions online, this is something RBS has and it would be very useful if BANK_NAME had it too. All in all, a very helpful banking service, not really sure where all of the negative reviews come from but I'm very pleased. "
Customer_1224, uncaring not helpful bank as they say they are ," my first problem was the ,new acc, i was givenA select platinum acc, i was told i had a £100 overdraft on the acc,But this was incorrrect i applied for the acc,online so BANK_NAME lied to meSecondly after now being given ,a select acc,I applied for the card reader option to my make my accfully activated for telephone bankingOI did this on the 28th April and as yet its still not activated even though,i,ve been sent two card readersComplaints department gave me a £25 ,compensationReward,but no letter of apology "
Customer_1225, Unhelpful to the point of being rude ," My partner and I are not BANK_NAME customers (thank goodness) - My partner used his Halifax card in their cash machine to check his balance - the machine then malfunctioned and swallowed his card.  This has happened at the worst possible time as his fathers funeral is in 2 days and he needs his card to pay for florists, caterers, funeral directors etc.  We went into the BANK_NAME Branch in Chesterfield and asked if the card could be retrieved, my partner had his drivers licence (with photo id) with him - the first person we spoke to asked my partners name and then went away - he came back around 5 mins later and asked if we were BANK_NAME Customers - we replied no and he then said I'm sorry, we cant help. We tried explaining the situation regarding the impending funeral and that we had plenty of ID and could answer any security questions etc - still point blank NO - I asked to speak to the manager and this person claimed he was the manager - (really??? - who did you go and ask about this for 5 minutes in the first place??) I understand security, fraud risk etc but would someone who has fraudulently tried to use a card really go into the bank, ask for it back and offer to provide ID and answer security questions??? - BANK_NAME - complete joke and in-human staff who are probably also blatant liars "
Customer_1226, Terrible company!!! ," My Partner and I moved our personal bank accounts to BANK_NAME from HSBC, they were very speedy with this part ( obviously as they wanted our money) whilst waiting for our bank cards to come through my partner went into the branch, as it was taking a while for them to arrive and asked the teller if there was a hold up. The teller advised her to go online and simply order a new card, if the original was to turn up just use that until the second card arrived. terrible advice. The next problem we encountered was that when we applied for the mortgage we had to have a 4.5 hour interview, we were in a tiny cramped office, with the mortgage chap and his manager. The room was very stuffy and warm with no windows and we weren't even offered a drink of water or any other refreshments with no toilets available either. However the manager thought it was ok to eat her lunch and drink her starbucks coffee. It almost felt as if we were an inconvenience to them. After the 4.5 hour interview we left and over the next couple of days jumped through numerous intrusive hoops ensuring that all papers requested by the bank were submitted. From that point things went really down hill, we never heard anything from the "" personal mortgage advisor"" unless we hounded him (even then he didn't seem to know what was happening). we made it clear in the interview that we had the house and everything in line and just needed the mortgage within 4 weeks max. After 3 weeks of not hearing anything from BANK_NAME we were getting a bit stressed to say the least, not even a credit check had been done. I personally rang the mortgage advisors direct mobile number 8 times within 2 days. Not one phonecall returned. Emails were sent along with a text explaining that we wished to cancel the application and leave the bank. Still nothing. I managed to get hold of the mortgage adviser, and asked why no return phonecall. The answer being that he was busy. So we cancelled everything and moved on. Last week we had a discussion with another, higher up BANK_NAME representative. He was insistent that a deal can be done"" and it would be flagged as a complaint and urgent matter. we were informed that the mortgage centre was going to ring us within the day to sort things out. Brilliant we thought. 3 business days later and still no phone call. So from our application (6 weeks ago) we have never once heard from the mortgage centre"
Customer_1227," After bad experience, finally great service at the branch. "," My rating has gone up, after I finally got the best service at the Chorley branch by Nicola from customer services.

Customer_1229, Bad Banking ," My wife and her cousin had to set up an executor account at the Basildon Branch of BANK_NAME. They arrived about 3pm and were seated in a private room. The person then left to photocopy the required documents. After 15 minutes my wife had to go looking for them. She found another member of staff who then found the missing member of staff. He then came back and asked if they could come back another time as he would not be able to deal with it. After some time the manager arrived and dealt with setting up the account. After profuse apologies they eventually left the branch about 5.20pm. The service given was extremely poor, reinforcing the poor reputation of banks generally. "

Customer_1240, Very poor customer service for business accounts ," BANK_NAME business banking will not give a branch phone number for Chester business centre, you ask to go to a named contact who is dealing with your case, NO, NO, NO!.  They insist you dial a generic business number and explain everything to a complete stranger, who will then spend five minutes asking you pointless information unrelated to your original phone call and THEN pass you through to Chester(5 mins later remember) who (DAVID) then insists there is NO DIRECT NUMBER, no mobile number, NOTHING AT ALL to contact your branch manager!  Customer service in the 21st century GUYS!!!.  My manager tried to make out that I had filled in some forms incorrectly, when I eventually got her to admit that it was BANK_NAME's fault as the form was INCORRECTLY printed- on a legal document (her words) to add a signature mandate on an account.  A week later, I AM STILL WAITING - Only to be told when BANK_NAME posts out a form back to you it doesn't just go into the Royal Mail post and get there next day, NOPE! it goes to a central postal system to then be posted out days later.  OMG, it would have been quicker for me to drive 18 miles to Chester and just re-sign the document. POOR, POOR, POOR effort Mr BANK_NAME! You need to up your game!!!! I hope the Chief Executive reads this and takes action. "

This isn't the first time they have done this in a hope I would not notice...Check your statements carefully!They obviously knew I had covered it and that they should not have taken the charges and were just going to ignore me. I now think our ancesters were right and its best to keep your money under your mattress because it is no safer in the bank, you still have robbing Ba*****s nicking your money "

This is because he is self-employed and not yet got got enough tax returns to do it himself.We found the perfect bungalow, got a mortgage in principle from BANK_NAME (again explicitly stating), and got our offer accepted. When coming to get a mortgage officially, they stated that they couldn't do it because she wasn't my blood relative or directly related through marriage!Other banks had stated this but BANK_NAME EXPLICITLY stated that it didn't matter to them.... until it came down to the crunch and it did!Now we could potentially loose a bungalow we have waited 2 years to be in a position to buy because we were so let down my BANK_NAME. I dont dare tell her yet to avoid upsetting her, I hope Which? Mortgages can resolve this mess for us. "

Went back to the store only to find the same issue again, card declined, even though there was sufficient funds. According to Fraud department if a transaction is deemed suspicious your card will be blocked. What they don't tell you is that even when they have unblocked it you can still have problems when you go back to the same store after 1 hour. Now left with a card that is not fit for purpose, tried to get some help from their Social Media Team and they were a waste of space  I am all for customer security but this is beyond security when you cannot even use your own debit card! Had the same issue happen in February and now 3 times in one day in March! "
Customer_1245, Unknowledgeable and Highly Not Recommended , BANK_NAME has some great facilities when it comes to consumer banking however I feel they need to be held more accountable for the actions they take. I had a bad experience in that they closed my account without giving a reason and when i wanted to make a complaint i was told i was not allowed to make a complaint under their terms and conditions of banking. Eventually I made a complaint through the ombudsman who BANK_NAME also ignored and felt they had the right to abuse the relevant laws and legislation in England and Wales. I would not recommend or use BANK_NAME due to their poor customer service and lack of knowledge around Data Protection legislation. 
Customer_1246, BANK_NAME land of fees ," BANK_NAME has to have staff that sole purpose is to find ways to make money based on fees.  They have direct debits which they can use to their advantage.  Our account pays rent on the 1st of every month, and they had noticed that sometimes we would not load money into the account until just before like 1-2 days before rent is due.  So what they would do is make rent go out on the 29th, it will fail, then they will have £30 fee for failed payment, now they hold this fee... they dont charge it immediately, because, why do that when they can make more money off that fee?  So they wait till another direct debit which they know about is about to go out and they know it will bring the account to close to a 0 balance, once that debit goes out, guess who decides to hit the fee for £30 out of the account then?  You guessed it.  Then, since that fee cant go out, they get to strike us with ANOTHER £30 fee because the fee payment was rejected, now they get 60, but since that account is still at 0 balance or nearby, the next day they will try BOTH fees again, and both will be rejected each earning another £30 fee each fail.  now they have 4 lots of 30 in fees, the account will go positive, and for a while stay that way, until the next time it drops below 30 and then BOOM another attempt for the fee money and earning them another £30 fee for THAT rejection.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK THEY ARE CRIMINALS! "
Customer_1247, Refuse to protect vulnerable relative from ongoing fraud ," BANK_NAME have (in my opinion) utterly failed to spot systematic looting of an elderly relative's bank account by dozens of dubious sky digibox and home appliance warranty companies over a period of years that has resulted in a loss of more than £20k. They will not instigate a complex fraud complaint and have allowed further unauthorised transactions even after being alerted to the problem. They deny receiving or refuse to accept letters signed by the account holder who is unable to speak to them on the phone or visit the bank personally following a stroke. They seem to have created administrative obstacles to even looking into the matter let alone resolving it in a timely manner, the latest of which is to claim that photo ID copied by an in branch advisor cannot be used to support a mandate of agency (essential me being allowed to ask questions about the account in compliance with the data protection act) was copied on the 'wrong kind of copier'. Despite several requests they have not provided the name of a senior person able to deal with our complaint. It is frustrating and time consuming, however I have learned how shockingly easy it is for someone with malign intent to access BANK_NAME customer accounts, set up online banking, create direct debits and continuous payment authorities with only basic account holder details. Whilst there should always be an element of the account holder taking responsibility to report bad transactions there are many, especially elderly people, who simply cannot read the small bank statements or who are easily confused and like my relative just hide everything away until it all becomes a massive problem. Also if BANK_NAME advertise account features that are designed to prevent fraud then the customer has a justifiable expectation that they will do that. Believe me a 30 second review of the transactions occurring on my relative's account scream that something is terribly wrong.I have created a Blog if anyone is interested in more detail about my particular story.telemarketingconcern.blogspot.co.ukThanks for reading and good luck if you are having issues.JOHN B "

Anyway she said they could a conference call with myself and my business partner as we could not go to BANK_NAME.

Customer_1291, Recently opened a joint bank account … ," Recently opened a joint bank account with them as me and my boyfriend were buying a property. 2 days before completion I went into the branch to transfer money to the solicitor and had forgot my PIN as I had been on the online banking and recently changed my online PIN, long story short I had got this PIN confused with my card PIN (so many numbers and passwords to remember I don’t get this with my other accounts with other banks) so I’m in branch I need to unblock my card whiich they can’t do without my PIN (the one which I forgot and blocked my card with!!) they said they will send it in the post and I will have to come back into branch or go to one of their ATM’s to unblock my card which can take up to 5 days!! I said I’m sorry and explained my situation hoping they could do something or ask me security questions or any other bloody number or password I have just not my PIN!!! They refused to. So basically if my partner can’t find a letter with the pin to his card somewhere we will lose this house.They’re just TOOO tight around security to the point I can’t even transfer money into MY OWN separate account if it’s more than 250 a day. Seriously wish I never set up an account with them. "

Customer_1293, Horrible customer service from Rishi ," Rishi needs a revaluation of what he considers customer service. I believe he has never come across this concept. I have never experience such a horrifying experience in my entire 30 years of banking. I have made 3 trips in one day, to the BANK_NAME branch in Fenchurch street and in every single trip, I have found Rishi sitting in the same chair with no communication with customers. Not even a smile or 'would you like some help?'. He is very lazy and simply sits down all day long, very unenthusiastic about assisting customers despite it being his job to do so! He will find any excuse not to help.Thankfully, Arshad (I believe that was his name) had decided to assist myself, providing an exceptional service and helping me with what I needed done within 10mins! Arshad was actually passionate about assisting customers unlike Rishi who is too busy relaxing on a chair to acknowledge customers. You will not find Rishi using the computer or actually helping customers - he simply relaxes too much! I am familiar with the Fenchurch branch and tend to go there often, and to no surprise to myself, I see Rishi doing the same thing, being no help at all to myself or others. "
Customer_1294, Rude and obnoxious advisors who are incompetent , Rude and obnoxious advisors who are incompetent woulf never use this bank ever again cant do a simple job as sending a new card out wasted 1 hour with an advisor who vouldbt help at all and told me to go to the branch 
Customer_1295, Sadly Customer Service no longer exists … ," Sadly Customer Service no longer exists at BANK_NAME. Too interested in profit, targets, and their own rules regardless of FCA mortgage porting rules.  Passed from pillar to post, incorrect information given and not even able to actually book an appointment with a person in branch face to face without various requirements being met first and some of those incorrect. Terrible mortgage wise :-( even after being a customer 30 years. "
Customer_1296, Colin Chettleburgh ," Seems I stand out in the crowd here, but I've just opened a new business account with BANK_NAME. Admittedly, my personal account has been with them 44 years, our mortgage is with them and my previous Company banked with them.However, from applying online to the account being able to receive funds took 48 hours. After another day, the account appeared on my personal Online Banking, so I was able to manage my money.2 days later, my debit card arrived, so I had a fully functioning account with debit card in 5 days. I'm just waiting on the business credit card now.All the way through, I was receiving pertinent, stylish and up-beat emails to keep me informed of what was going on. I can't see how anyone could possibly have done any better.Interestingly, I originally applied to RBS as they were offering a further 6 months of free banking. All very well, but all I had back was an awful email (badly laid out, no branding, impersonal, curt) acknowledging receipt. When I chased up a week later, I was asked 'hasn't anyone been in touch?'. Joke, right? Was told I would need a business review before they could process and no appointments available before Christmas, meaning it would be an absolute minimum of 4 weeks to open, more likely 6.It's hard to believe these are sister companies and it's no wonder RBS struggle. "
Customer_1297, Bank Account Hacked & Debit card compromised ," Several weeks ago, my bank account was hacked. The hackers moved £12.5k from my savings account into my current account and then attempted to spend it.  Their first transaction was for almost £10K to BANK_NAMEcard, using my debit card.  Their second transaction for almost £1K, triggered a fraud alert.  First I knew, I received an email from BANK_NAME telling me my BANK_NAME 3D Secure password had been changed. (the screen you get after you've put your card details in online) The fraudsters had got all the way to the debit card security screen but then unable to get my password right, they had called the number and merely answered some security questions AND GOT THE PASSWORD CHANGED!!!!! What's the point of having this? Not exactly 'Secure' is it? Think they should change the name??     BANK_NAME has been utterly useless in providing information. They flatly refuse to let me listen to the phonecall to see if it's someone known to me. They have taken 6wks to answer my questions (I'm still waiting for more info) And the person dealing with my 'escalated' complaint sounds like she's on work experience. She's really wooden and is clearly just reading from other people's emails when she calls me. She frequently puts me on hold because she has to 'ask her manager' pretty much everything. There's a lot of a**e-covering going on.  BANK_NAME's explanation is that 1 of 3 things have happened. 1) My home computer has been hacked. - I've had Apple experts look at my 3month old MacBook Pro and tell me this has NOT happened.  2) I've been phished - I am phishing savvy and know never to open the links. Besides all phishing emails go in my Junk folder. 3) I've written down all my passwords and someone's stolen them - Do they think I am completely stupid??? I've told that there has to be another explanation, that NONE of these things happened but this renders the BANK_NAME girl speechless and she merely reads her script to me again!  Infuriating.   Over the course of that day, the hackers changed the email address and mobile number on the account. I SHOULD have received a series of text alerts that day as the fraudsters made each transaction. BANK_NAME have spent weeks dodging all the awkward questions but finally admitted that, rather conveniently, their text alerts system was down that day. Alarmingly, they tried to suggest that perhaps I hadn't 'opted in' to the fraud alert service. WHAT KIND OF BANK HAS AN OPT-IN FRAUD ALERT SERVICE?? If you are a BANK_NAME Customer you need to check that you have opted in to this!! Is there anyone who would not want it???  Then again if you are a BANK_NAME customer you should think about moving your money to a bank that protects its customers (and its customer's money) a little better.  After weeks of saying they won't prosecute, they are now saying they might but I will never be told. So whether it's someone within the bank or someone known to me, I will never know. "
Customer_1298, Shocked and appalled by BANK_NAME …DONT JOIN BANK_NAME , Shocked and appalled by BANK_NAME Underwriter. Given bad advice in branch. Now have been turned down to loan. Then told we gave too much information. Ageism. Not one bank charge in 60 yrs of banking. Never have I been overdrawn. I have a healthy amount  of income. Dreadful bank. 
Customer_1299, customer service call centre , shocked by the unpleasant attitude of these persons. 
Customer_1300, Very poor service. ," Signed up awhile ago for BANK_NAME's text service where they inform you if your current account goes overdrawn and supposedly allow you time to rectify the situation. Today I had such a text, the only problem being that the account went overdrawn at 6.30 am and the text wasn't received until 4.30 pm - and on a Friday, too. NOT the first tme this has happened but, whereas before I could go into my local branch to resolve the issue, this has now been closed down. Phoned customer services to complain. Waited 15 minutes before my call was answered. Explained the situation reasonably and politely. Was put on hold. And then cut off. I hate BANK_NAME. "
Customer_1301, Simply CRAP ," Simply CRAPStarted asking me stupid and obscure questions, that qualify for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire e.g: you pay a breakdown service, who would the payment go to,A. AAB. RACC. GreenflagD. None of the above.???Firstly, i don't pay for a break down service, secondly questions so secure that end user can't get access. In the end had to go to the local branch with photo id. "
Customer_1302," If you're moving overseas, move your funds to a different bank! ", Since moving overseas many years ago it has been difficult for me to access funds from my own account.  I have not been able to update my address and have been advised repeatedly by customer services  that I physically  need to go into a branch to do this! (Do they expect me to fly into the country?!).  My cards have been sent to old addresses and I have not received them.  New activation codes for online banking have also been sent to old addresses.  If BANK_NAME cannot provide services to international clients they should inform them to change banks prior to moving overseas! 
Customer_1303, So bad words fail me ," So bad words fail me, absolutely run by idiots with no customer service. with out doubt the BANK_NAME just goes from bad to worse..Will update with details when things become clearer, please don't bank with these idiots. "
Customer_1304, Another One Bites The Dust ," So here we are, BANK_NAME has decided to close the last bank in Penistone - despite assurances twelve months ago that they would remain open. That will leave us with no banks at all in a town of some 25,000 people, and growing very fast.When the second last bank closed in 2016 (HSBC), BANK_NAME mopped up most of these clients on the assurance they would remain open.It is likely there will be no secure cash points in town now (one of the other two available is known to have been scammed)Weak government with a conspiracy to force us into internet banking and a cashless society I think!Penistone is now left with only one financial institution - (YBS), for the moment, offering no cash machine and limited opening.

As i right this I'm on hold with the 3 person after 1.5 hour they advised there is a problem and can seem to get through to business team and will have to call back.

They didn't"
Customer_1313," Such high hopes, such poor service.... "," Such high hopes, such poor service.... Please prepare yourself for a rant... We were considering switching to BANK_NAME for the 2% cashback for a while and then the switch bonus came up so we thought why not. So carried on and applied for a joint account to switch from our current one with Santander back in Jan 2018 and have had problems ever since. We didn't receive the right paperwork at all and they blamed us for it when I phoned asking for an update. Eventually got the paperwork, sent it back, still no response. Phone for an update, sorry we didn't receive the joint account holder's signature. Re-sent us the paperwork, re-signed, re-sent (special delivery!). Great okay processing. Text message to both of us to say it's been over 28 days since you applied, please confirm you still want to proceed. Both text back. Couple days go by with nothing, safe to say I was a bit paranoid due to problems so far.... so phone for an update, sorry we haven't received confirmation from the joint applicant! (Argh!) So he phones up and confirms he is happy for it to proceed and we should wait 5-7 workings days. 5 days later, both get an email saying it's been over 28 days since you applied, please re-apply online. Last phone call I hope I will ever have with BANK_NAME was this morning to ask why we are now being asked to re-apply online, with them saying just to make you aware as the account isn't even open yet we may not qualify for the switch bonus as the deadline is 16th March (I applied 26th Jan!) so after all that we just cancelled and said we were not happy for this to proceed. If it's this hard to even BECOME a customer pretty sure we dodged a bullet of BEING a customer! Switched my personal account to Halifax 2 years back and it was open with the £125 bonus in 8 days..... Halifax recommended, BANK_NAME definitely not!! "

And that's after giving them 1000 different pin numbers and passwords etc, what a joke. And surprise supprise, all banks within 100 mile radius are closed at the weekends!!!   Extremely annoyed is an understatement. I've literally lost thousands because of this! Staff tell me different things, such as yes we can definitely do that with telephone banking, then, oh, sorry, computer says no!  You can't actually access your own money, as we are lending it out to everyone else.   Jeez.   The sooner bitcoin takes over the better, I want to look after my own money myself!!    Sort it out BANK_NAME!!!! "
Customer_1316," Not bad, not brilliant either "," Switched to BANK_NAME four years ago. The main attraction for me was UK customer service and that still remains the case. I've never had a terrible experience when dealing with them over the phone. The Android app is very good in comparison to other banking apps, however it is often unavailable whilst they undertake maintenance. This can be extremely annoying as I don't see why this maintenance cannot be carried out without interfering with people's daily banking facilities. Strongly suspect this is due to their very poor outdated systems but then again, all banks pay a pittance for their technology and they're all behind the times in that respect. All the fancy stuff is put out there in the branches to attract customers but under the hood it's an entirely different kettle of fish. Branches seem to be OK, I've used them a handful of times so can't comment too much there. A big gripe for me now is that they don't seem to be supporting Android Pay. This has been out for months now and I'm currently looking into getting an account with a bank who does support it as I'm very much into mobile banking and being able to pay for things with as little hassle as possible. With regards to the reviewer who had his account frozen by BANK_NAME and claims this was 'unlawful', this is not the case at all and I'd suggest anyone who believes this to dissect the terms and conditions of their account. Essentially, any bank is entitled to place a freeze on an account at any time if they believe they have sufficient concerns to do so. They do NOT have to tell you the full details why. I will not go into specifics about this for obvious reasons but banks are required by law to adhere to anti-money laundering and fraud regulations. If they have sufficient reason to believe anything like that is happening on an account, even if it all turned out to be perfectly legitimate in the end, they are still entitled to freeze an account and withhold money from someone if they had evidence AT THE TIME to justify those actions. I appreciate that person who wrote that review went through a terrible experience but some of what was written in that review is not correct, and I'm saying that as someone who's worked in the banking industry (NOT employed by BANK_NAME) for over a decade. I would not wish for anyone to be misled by that review and think that a bank is breaking the law by freezing an account because that is absolutely not the case. "

Customer_1318, Rude customer service ," Telephoned the customer service team and encountered a rude staff. When the staff was asking for my details, he did not make clear what he was asking for and he did not give clear instructions. When I asked for further clarifications, I was met with condescending replies. However, he did manage to direct me sufficiently to another team to help solve my problem.

Customer_1321, Terrible bank ," Terrible bank! Tried to open a new account with them for the cashback offer. Filled in the online application and was told I was accepted. On the next page was then told they would be posting me a document to sign and either send back or bring into a branch. That was the first annoyance as I've opened banks purely online before (isn't that the point?) and not had to send in paperwork or visit a branch. A week later I received the single page document saying all they need is my signature so I signed and posted it back the same day. A further week on and I hadn't heard anything from them so I called them only to be told on the phone they needed my ID and I would need to go into a branch to do this. They were unable to tell me why I was not notified of this. I booked an appointment with a branch for that week, went in with my ID, had it scanned and was told they would send it in right away and I should hear back within 3-5 days. I waited yet another week without any word from them so called up again and was told that the head office never received my ID. They also said that the branch should have finished opening my account for me while I was there so I would have to go in again and get it done. I was not willing to continue with this mess of a bank so I finally told them to shut the application and I wouldn't be going ahead with the account. "

I felt like BANK_NAME tried to profit from my misfortune- offering me loans,  telling me I'd be charged for payments I couldn't make, charging me for the overdraft I had to take out to cover the direct debits etc. Expect to spend hours on the phone trying to sort things and be ready to be passed from pillar to post. I'd been a customer for nearly 20 years, not any more. "

Customer_1332, Bank Closures ," The closures of two branches of BANK_NAME Bank, both  in Devon, United Kingdom, and both of which I have used on a regular basis, having been a long-term member - Ivybridge, Devon and Kingsbridge, Devon, have caused me considerable inconvenience.To access a branch of BANK_NAME from where I live it is necessary to drive for nearly half an hour to a town called Plympton, and because this company no longer values it's customers I have decided to transfer my business to BANK_NAME Bank, where there is a branch in Ivybridge, and also Kingsbridge.A recent problem, aside from the closures, was trying to obtain a paying-in book via on-line banking. I was informed that would take five days - now it has taken two weeks, so I ordered another one recently from Plympton, I need one before I transfer my business elsewhere.Also, with the Mobile Banking that is being offered, 1 hour, each week? I would still have to walk a mile to access it, and have no confidence in the security aspect, being vulnerable as a customer using the service.It must be obvious why In need to change my bank. "

No consideration or loyalty was forthcoming from our local branch manager either.Several months later they decided to close down our account, and once again there was no explanation, but probably because they could see we'd already started to move our transactions elsewhere.Judging by the wealth of negative feedback from other dissatisfied customers it's a wonder this bank is still functioning.

Firstly, they send me a card which i never received when the bank account was opened. 2nd time its over ten days and still waiting for it. Then they disable my account on suspicion of fraud and make me to 4 call of atleast 1 hour long. They made me to go to their branch twice because bank made mistake taking ID. Then started to cut my calls off.I am still waiting for my account to be enabled. BANK_NAME is not recommended at all "
Customer_1349, From bad to worse... ," Their whole system is designed to make life as difficult as they possibly can to their customers. There is not unified criteria on anything. One person tells you one thing another the opposite, you are constantly in limbo with them. One thing is possible one day, the next day is not. Nobody gives the right information and to make matters worse, they have no respect for people. "
Customer_1350, What is wrong with this bank?? ," There appears to be a thread developing here.I applied on line, and was then requested to call the 0345 300 3914 number to confirm and discuss details of my application.  I should allow 45 mins for the call.I called on Thursday 17/11/16 at 1140 and I have now been on hold for over 54 mins in a queue for the next available business specialist who will be with me shortly....."""
Customer_1351, I will never bank with BANK_NAME....EVER AGAIN! ," There are so many reasons why I would never bank with BANK_NAME; ever again...but I could be writing this post for hours. So, I shall try to keep things brief.I have been a loyal customer of BANK_NAME's since February 2013; holding a Cash ISA savings account with them since then. However, a few weeks ago; they slashed my interest rate from a rubbish 0.5% to an even more pitiful 0.25% (despite me transferring £200 every single month; and hardly withdrawing any money). Upon receiving this email; I decided that enough was enough; and decided to close this account. A few months ago, they revoked my Internet banking access (as I had closed my current account with them***). Not long before receiving the email about my interest rate halving; they closed up my mobile banking as well; so I no longer had a visual of my money. This frightened me a little bit; but I was planning to close the account anyway; so I didn't bother getting my access revoked.So, I go into the main branch in Bristol; and they tell me that they can do a CHAPS transfer (normally costing £23). This is for high value payment transfers, and tell me it will take 1 business working day. But wait! They then tell me that they will wave the £23 fee; in lieu of the 12p interest they owed me. I thought I was getting a pretty good deal; so I went for it. This was on the Friday (after the 2pm cut off point for CHAPs payments).(I have since found out that CHAPs payments should only be for £20,000+ amounts --- and I had a lot less than this to transfer! A good job they didn't charge me the £23 after all, eh)?When we were filling out the CHAPs forms; my advisor went to speak to her colleague who informed her that the forms had been filled out incorrectly. But wait! What did she tell me? She told me everything was sorted and I could leave - she didn't realise I had overheard her speaking to her colleague! They couldn't give me any paperwork to prove the transfer had been processed either...a little strange, no?!Anyway, I was promised the funds would be transferred on Monday - happy days! Throughout the Monday; I was checking my bank account to see the money was in there. As I didn't have BANK_NAME online banking anymore, I couldn't check that; could I? By 8am Tuesday; the money was still not transferred! I was now more than a little worried.I popped into branch who confirmed the money was transferred on the Tuesday; and my other bank would need to accept the funds. So, another good job I didn't have to pay the CHAPs fee as the funds were transferred a whole 24 hours after the date they promised!So, what have I got from my time with BANK_NAME? 1. Staff lying to me2. Delayed transfers of my life savings3. Stress, hassle & countless worry4. A whole lot of relief that I no longer have to bank with them!My recommendation would be to check out other banks - a whole lot less hassle, stress and lies; and probably better interest rates too!GOODBYE BANK_NAME - I WILL NOT MISS YOU!*** PS I closed my current account with them as they kept blocking access to my funds everytime I tried to book a holiday. Oh, and they don't tell you they're doing that! I only found out when I tried to pay by card in store, and kept getting declined. A trip into branch always resolved the matter; but seriously; could they not have phoned, emailed, texted...something? My new bank; Nationwide send me a courteous text to ensure I've made an unusual transaction; and I just reply to say it was me. "
Customer_1352, Bunch of clowns , These people are complete idiots I have got an account that they refuse to let me close unless I sign paper work but considering I never signed in the first place don't see why so I have withdrawn all funds and cancelled my direct debits well done clowns 
Customer_1353, They are crap , They are crap. Been with them nearly all my life. i am now 72 and leaving the lying greedy none understanding bank. Dont go with them. there lie and lie. 
Customer_1354, Useless bank operated by idiots , They are so bad i don't even want to talk about them. Avoid them and find a decent bank that cares. Absolutely unprofessional and time wasters. Should not be called a bank but a market stall. 
Customer_1355, Useless money grabbing bunch of unhelpful bankers ," They are unhelpful when you have a problem. Their website has been offline more times than I could count. As I travel around the North East I visit a few different branches which are all woefully understaffed with people who are about as helpful as syphillis. No Email address to communicate via. They messed the relative easy job of opening my business account up so much I cancelled before it was even finalised. They have messed up a couple of very important transfers with no apology or quick solution which caused me to lose £100's if not £1000's. THEY ARE USELESS, STAY AWAY!! "
Customer_1356, Not helpful if card is stolen ," They aren't helpful at all if you're robbed and lose your cash cards. I cancelled my card after answering security questions and they told me that it was fine so they would send me out my new card. Then they said my online banking had been closed and put me through to the security department who said they didn't know why I had been put through to them, but my card had definitely been ordered, and if I answer more security questions they would set up the online banking again. Then they asked me a stupid question about transactions that I couldn't remember, so I said I can't remember and could they ask another one, but he said the computer says I have to answer a multiple choice question and they have no control on what the questions are, so I said I'm not sure and would only be guessing and I don't want to guess as I have no money for food or petrol, and he was quite rude and said I had to answer it but I got the question wrong and then he said computer says so, but my card would definitely be sent out, so I said it was a stupid question and I can't believe he was so unhelpful. So I wait days for the card only eating cereal with no milk wondering why it was taking so long, and after 5 days I phone up again and they told me that there's no record of me ordering the card, so the last person i spoke to must have cancelled my card without telling me, and I'm told that I have to go into my branch which is now only open a couple of days a week. I said my petrol has nearly ran out and it's not open again for days, and I was told I should beg people for money and food until i can get to a branch. It's obvious the one who was unhelpful cancelled the ordering my card on purpose to be nasty. They made a stressful time even worse "
Customer_1357, Terrible customer support ," They closed my account for some unknown reason, never reopened it back for me but instead sent me some debt recovery monkeys to retrieve the unpaid overdraft from my card. I was sent around in circles by their support personnel up to the point of ignoring me completely and forwarding my calls to external debt recovery companies like the trained monkeys from Moorcraft and STA Graydon.Disgraceful service, would not recommend them to anyone. "
Customer_1358, Do not buy building and contents with BANK_NAME ," They do not deserve any stars, unless they had a section for minuses. Do not buy buildings and contents from these insurers. If you have a water leak they do not want to pay. They take forever, to make a decision which goes against there service level agreements. They send out people to survey the property who are not experts in construction. We have a highly maintained house and they have said the water leak is wear and tear, which is rediculous. They have blamed it on the grouting but the attached wall is not wet or damp. We have also paid for search and find (additional insurance), but they are not even honouring that. Shame on you BANK_NAME we are now pulling all our business accounts, personal accounts and mortgage to go to a bank that actual puts the customer first! "
Customer_1359, TYPICAL AS THERE STATE RUN AT THE MOMENT , THEY DON'T  SEEM TO GIVE A DAM ABOUT THERE CUSTOMERS AND THERE PERSONAL PROBLEMS THERE JUST PENNY PINCHER'S  EITHER THEY GOT NO HEART  OR THERE MACHINES 
Customer_1360, disgrsceful ," they just lie, promise and promise we will call you back and never hear from them againthen when u try to ring again snd express your disatisfsction they hang upi am at my wits end trying to resolve sn issue eith them but time and time again its all kids in a call centre fobbing you off and hanging up so today im going into branch and not leaving until resolved and i dont care if they call the police as thats there favourite threat - your disgusting pathetic bunch of liars ntwset "
Customer_1361, Too few staff in branches ," They never have staff at their customer service desks, (Halifax do). This means you have to wait in long queues to ask them a question. Every time I go past a BANK_NAME theres always a queue. Its not good enough. Queuing wastes our valuable time. They don't have enough fully trained staff in their branches. I've complained to them before about this but being a corporate PLC bank their customers views are virtually irrelevant to them. "
Customer_1362, They offer no loyalty to their … ," They offer no loyalty to their customers and I've been with them for 15 years. They don't advise you when you've got over your unarranged overdraft and charge you £6 a day and then write a letter to tell you, even if you have funds in other accounts with them. Their reward silver account keeps getting more expensive and costs £10 a month, and you only  get a taste card which you can use anywhere anyway. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone so happy I've changed bank "
Customer_1363," awful service, people-DO NOT USE BANK_NAME !!! "," They provide poor service. They wasted our time with mortgage, every time we put OR withdraw OUR money from account, they ask WHAT FOR / Why ? Have a look other comments, most of the people put 1 star. BANK_NAME MUST be closed down ASAP ! "
Customer_1364, usless uncaring corporate b*stards ," they really could not care less if you were starving to death due to their technical issues, and have the cheek to fob you off with one of their lying c*unts reading from a script on another continent, thieving useless bas*tards and they don't even wonder why we hate them "
Customer_1365, This bank gets worse , This bank gets worseThey closed my local branch last year and the next nearest will go later this  yearYou would think telephone contact would improve but that gets worseHelp with internet banking is a chatline only which is poor at bestWriting this while I wait for them to answer which is now 15 minutes 
Customer_1366, STUPID APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS ," This bank has the most excess requirements when opening an account with them. I applied for an Adapt Account and was rejected for not having the same surname as my father. WHAT THE HELL. I then went to Santander to see if they would accept my application and they said they would. I ended up opening an account with Halifax and have no problems at all. If you want a bank which doesn't have the most unnecessary requirements then I suggest you look at other banks, BANK_NAME isn't an option. "
Customer_1367, This bank is a shame ," This bank is a shame . Awful customer service and bad behaviour.   This bank is not competent and responsible .  It's one thing to identify a problem and it's another thing to handle the problems identified effectively and efficiently.  Putting customers in an unpleasant state is inappropriate.  BANK_NAME is not protective enough .  I was assured that I could use my card in few minutes.  But , nothing was done about it . My child and   I was ignored and  neglected and we were left without any fund . "
Customer_1368, They think terminal cancer's a reason to ignore me. ," This company are the lowest form of dirt. Having got cancer, and needing proof of address to qualify for a travel pass, I thought they might be helpful and send me a statement. Oh my word how wrong I was... they promised time and time again they would, but didn't. When I struggled in to the branch, it took an hour and a half to persuade them to, I genuinely believe they were waiting for me to die so they wouldn't have to bother. Does it get worse than that from a bank? Oh and they've pilfered hundreds in unjustifiable fees. "
Customer_1369," Whilst closing branches, the on-line facility is rubbish … ", This company is closing down local branches - ie my nearest branch is 6 miles away and they are closing in May 2018.   I have an online banking facility but frankly this is a joke.   Just doesn't seem to work well at all and has a '1' rating from Trustpilot.    I have decided to change banks. 
Customer_1370, I'm lovin them ," This is a great bank with  leading edge technology.  They have clearly invested in their  branches and value their staff.  As a customer I feel valued and have recommended many people to them. Their rates and fees maybe not as competitive as others ,  yet this is made up for by the service and experience you gain . "
Customer_1371, Absolutely disgusted. Proof of a bank putting profit directly before customer care ," This is a review of the Stafford Business Centre and BANK_NAME Complaints Team.I have been with BANK_NAME for over thirty years, and have personal, saving and business accounts. I have spent around fifteen years working in banking (including BANK_NAME), and also have accounts with BANK_NAME, Santander, Nationwide and Britannia (Co-Op).BANK_NAME used to offer me the best premier accounts, highest saving rates, lowest loans and a very personal service through the same long standing relationship managers.Gradually, the local ownership and control was lost, especially with the takeover by RBS.Now, the most common communication from BANK_NAME is the notification of a new relationship manager every few months, and the introduction of a monthly £10 charge on the business account, which in previous years had always been waived due to the very small number of electronic transactions and lack of cash or cheque processing.I have just complained about paying £70 in fees on an account with around £170 in it.They could have told me about 'Direct banking' where there is no monthly charge but that isn't managed within the Stafford Business Team and so would effectively be a loss of an account for them. So, my £70 has not been used to give me any advice or even notice of all alternatives within the bank, and costs of running the account must be pence.The complaints team is like the scene from the start of 'Hot Fuzz'... Would you like to make a complaint, which will then be 'looked at' (for a month or two) just to make sure that legally the bank can avoid any responsibility, before repeating the original decision.Sound familiar? It's the same attitude, we have seen with the Investment Banking crisis, and the miss-selling of endowmentsThe good news is that moving a personal account and any direct debits, etc. attached can be completed by your new bank within a week. Both Nationwide and Santander have unique offerings which has meant that my banking service is once again personable, professional, low cost and with much much greater benefits for me: A far more comprehensive low cost 'premier' package (Nationwide), cashback on bills/supermarket spending/petrol (Santander) and up to 3% interest (both).I haven't needed the personal attention from someone I know because everyone is so helpful, professional and friendly.In summary, I could not recommend the Stafford Business Team. I have no faith at all in the BANK_NAME complaints team. The products are outdated, relying on people staying put or in my case miss-guided and un-reciprocated loyalty. And if we tolerate it, they won't change... but the silver lining - my eyes have been opened to what is available elsewhere. "
Customer_1372, The most disgusting service I have ever encountered. ," This is quite simply unbelievable.I have been trying to open a new business account since first thing Monday morning. Completed the online application but apparently BANK_NAME still need to speak with me to discuss the business. They made one attempt to call my mobile which I missed as I was not expecting a call from them.The number they left was 0800 151 0579. I spend the entire Monday trying to get through with the all so common “we are very busy at the moment” nonsense and could not get through despite waiting for over an hour each time. If you are so incredibly busy then hire more staff, it is very simple logic. When I finally managed to get through at around 16:20 I was told this is the wrong number because it is for RBS and the number I need to call is 0345 300 3914. But they will get someone to call me back in 20 minutes. Guess what? Yep, no call back.So I spend all morning on hold to the 0345 300 3914 number, over 2 ½ hours on hold and eventually gave up. Tried business customer services who said there is nothing he could do except also try this number that nobody seems to answer.He suggested I go into the bank to see if the business manager could help. I asked if I could phone my branch (I bank there personally and have another business account there). No, the branch do not take phone calls. Seriously? How on earth can you run a business like this.So I take his advice and drive into the city and go to the branch. I am immediately told there is absolutely nothing they can do to help there and all they can do is also call this number.I am now back in the office and on hold to this number, so far it’s been 40 minutes with the music from Gladiator playing but constantly interrupted every 10 seconds by a pre-recorded lie that someone will be with me shortly. This is the most disgusting service I have ever encountered. "
Customer_1373, The best!!!!! , This is the best bank I've used in UK. Have been with BANK_NAME since 2001 and have other bank accounts like hsbc and BANK_NAME and have tried Halifax too. BANK_NAME has the best banking system. Hsbc is a nightmare. 
Customer_1374, THis is the worst bank one ca , THis is the worst bank one can choose to bank with. Choose them with care because they are worthless and the customer service is completely rubbish. I consider it’s now time to move banks 
Customer_1375, This particular bank is part operated … ," This particular bank is part operated or owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland who if you read their reviews are a totally unprofessional company who dont know what theyre doing.Now this particular is bank operated on all the same principles or unprofessioanlism as RBS and has a habit of randomly sifting through accounts conducted in a perfectly good and legal manner and then closing them purely for the sake of it and unreasonably refusing to give references, even though the customer has done nothing wrong whatsoever and is a perfectly good customer that other banks would be only too happy to take on. They allow you to withdraw any funds under such circumstances and remain polite when you go in the branch.Now Im not saying the staff who take the decision to close your account are stupid, unintelligent or anything like that, I am just simply trying to say that they are complete bafoons who ought to be put in a mental hospital "
Customer_1376, This review is about 12 years late. … ," This review is about 12 years late. But still relevant. I noticed some odd behaviour on my account and this then made me notice i hadnt had a bank statement in quite a while. I went into my local branch to see if they had any ideas what was going on. They pulled up the info which showed my acount had been getting charges due to some missing cash, small amounts every month. I asked why i hadnt recieved statements for quite a few months and they said they had records of the statements being sent. I checked the adress they were sending them to and found it to be one i never lived anywhere near. I even wrote my address down on their forms on the standard COA forms. When they realised what they had done they sent me a letter saying i was an undesirable customer and my account was to be closed with immediate effect.  I asked one of their staff the next day if they thought it sounded fair to which they said, quite strongly, not at all. They offered an interview with the branch manager, which i was pleased about but declined, as they messed up that badly so far, THEY were an undesirable bank for ME. Been with Santander ever since. No problems so far. Quite the opposite. "
Customer_1377, This scumbag bank never cease to amaze… ," This scumbag bank never cease to amaze me, terrible customer service, terrible technology, I literally have nothing good to say about this bank. Laziness has kept me with them, but that is swiftly changing. No wonder you have the biggest count of current account leavers. Absolute shambles of a bank. "
Customer_1378, Not a clear service... ," Thought i opened a simple step account, later realised they put me on a expensive blue account i didnt need. "
Customer_1379, Great customer service ," TLDR - The Ealing-Uxbridge road branch didn't let me open an account and I'm still a fan. Having recently arrived in the UK, I had booked an appointment through their phone service, to open a current account this morning. It turns out that I may have been booked at a different branch or the system lost my booking. Either ways, I was not on the system, but the manager (Manav) did see me after a short wait. Ultimately it was not possible for me to open an account because of the specific situation with my visa, however the manager went way beyond my expectations, providing me with information, explanations, advice and my next options.  This was such a marked contrast to the experience I had at my wife's bank, a couple of days ago. I will definitely be going back to this BANK_NAME branch, once my situation is sorted out.  -Nigel "
Customer_1380, The worst customer service I have ever received ," To be honest I feel defeated by BANK_NAME. Having banked with BANK_NAME for the past ten years I expected better. First they 'in error' out a default payment on my credit file of which they could 'only apologise for' this, needless to say has destroyed my, what was perfect credit rating and I can no longer get credit anywhere as a result. Secondly two days before Christmas, after settling a loan with them three months ago over the phone with an advisor, I receive a final notice saying I still owe money on that loan again and have to pay it immediately, leaving me broke over Christmas. The advisor could not advise any alternative. The letter said they had 'compensated me £100' in an account I do not own and which the advisor on the phone could not find either. They say 'at BANK_NAME we are what we do' well in simple terms they are awful. I will be moving in the new year when I will be changing mortgage provider and bank (both with BANK_NAME) and never look back. I recommend banking with anyone else but BANK_NAME. They should be ashamed of themselves. "
Customer_1381, Worst bank in the world , To long to post here but they abandoned me and my family abroad due to an agents inability to speak English will nerver ever use again 
Customer_1382, WORST BANK EVER! ," Took a personal loan out with BANK_NAME in November last year, all was well till a few months ago. Wrote to BANK_NAME to tell them that I had lost my job and that I couldn't afford repayments and to ask if I could change, never heard anything back from them. My account I had with them I was asked if I wanted an overdraft I said no, cue end of Feb them taking my loan out of my account and after cancelling other direct debits 2 weeks before still took all the money out of my account! I was left 400 over drawn and BANK_NAME did not sympathise with me. I was a single mother  pregnant with twins and already had a 2 year old. 4 months it has taken for me to get out of my over draft with no income bar my child benefit. I've occurred over £300 in feeS and they will not refund me even though it was classed as financial hardship. I had to borrow money off family and friends and I missed 2 loan payments with them, I have paid one back to the get a letter that they want all the money by the 3rd of August. Avoid this bank. They help themselves to your money and have no care for any of there customers. So glad I have changed bank "
Customer_1383, Total rubbish never works contact less … , Total rubbish never works contact less is like a week behind in pay slip online banking never works can't save paye contacts the app works %50  of the time and the cards break after 2 months if a new one 
Customer_1384, Discusting customer service ," Totally disgusted with their on-line service! From poorly laid out application system, not recognising my card, not allowing me to use a card reader which has delayed payments to customers and suppliers. slowing my Business to a crawl!  I have lost trust in BANK_NAME, I am actively looking for a viable alternative. "
Customer_1385, thieves in every way shape and form. DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH BANK_NAME , Trash trash trash. Locked out of my account for weeks nothing but hassle and effort spent 6hrs+ trying to regain access to my account. AVOID 
Customer_1386, Terrible online applications ," Tried to open a student account with BANK_NAME via their online application forms.At no point did it ask me to provide evidence of being a student, they decided to open a basic non-student account without telling me. I was on hold for over an hour just to cancel the application.The whole experience has completely put me off "
Customer_1387, Tried to open an account and was given … , Tried to open an account and was given different information on several occasions. Then the last time the assistant accidentally kept one of my items of ID and gave me a sheet with information meant for staff instead. It had several spelling and grammatical errors. It could just be our local branch that's like this but it didn't fill me with confidence so will try another bank. 
Customer_1388, Tried to switch to a student account … , Tried to switch to a student account online TWICE after being told at the branch I needed to do it myself at home? The online service said my switch had been successful TWICE but neither times has anything changed regarding my account. Pathetic 
Customer_1389, Mission Impossible ," Tried to update my mobile number, the online banking app does not let you do this.Called the BANK_NAME helpline (3 LEVEL security check), they can't update contact details either. They advised to order a card reader, I asked if they could place the order for me now - again unable to assist.WHAT CAN THEY DO ??Completely Useless !! "
Customer_1390, A struggling bank? ," Try calling BANK_NAME's customer helpline and see how long it takes you to get through.. Their automated message informs you that they're experiencing higher than normal call volumes.. what at 3am in the morning? In fact, It doesn't matter what time of day you call them, you can expect the same message and a long wait to speak with an advisor. When you do get through, they're not so helpful and the simplest of issues are an uphill struggle. My local branch has also closed.. BANK_NAME is showing all the signs of a struggling bank, so if you want hassle free banking with a can do attitude, it's first direct all the way! "
Customer_1391, Switching account , Try to switch account to BANK_NAME. Good luck... 
Customer_1392, Trying to do a switch to BANK_NAME with … ," Trying to do a switch to BANK_NAME with my all 3 accounts, took them 3 weeks to check me and after that, they did open one account only.Calling customer service they could not find any info in the system for others accounts even with ref no. they have sent me by post.Did go to the branch and the lady she didn't had a clue how to look on the system for my name.Very bad customer service and very rude and unprofessional behaviour.

Customer_1394, I hate what they done to me ," Two things so I left and will never recommend.Got my first job at 16 by boss gave me a cheque I had no bank account so I put it in my sisters account. The cheque bounced so I had to pay  £30 so I did.  Then the following month a day the 5 other month they made me pay 30 each month! I was to young to understand what was going on so I still paid it!Second one When I turned 17 I wanted my own account so I booked an appointment the stupid manager opened up a advantage gold account for me despite you had to be 18 and I was 17, when I realised they where taking £15 from my account each month of got angry and cancelled the advantage gold so I got my refund back but I also withdrew all my money as I was angry with what they done when I was 16... it doesn't end there over being 7p over drawn they charged me £30!! I ignored them till the fine when over £1000 in the end of paid just over £200 to stop it and not be black listed.  Point is if that idiot never opened the advantage gold I wouldn't of been in that mess and I wouldn't of had to pay just over 200 over 7p. What makes me angry still today I was earning  £3.85 an hour and I served myself for a month just to pay that as I was in part time work doing college. I hate you so much BANK_NAME! Halifax is the best branch! "

UK INSURANCE  not nice people 
Customer_1396, Appalling customer service , Unable to speak to anyone re mortgage. Left in queue until you hang up in frustration. quickest call back request is 6 days away and no-one calls. This experience is repeated over and over again. I have tried to remortgage with them for a year and have yet to speak to anyone! 
Customer_1397, Simply shocking ," Unacceptably bad.  I needed my account number, but BANK_NAME don't send me statements or anything in the post. The only way to get that was online banking - problem was I couldn't remember my customer number, and to recover that I needed my account number, which I could only obtain by going into my online bank account. Total catch 22. Most non-crap banks have the sense to put this information on the debit card - say I'm out and I need to have money wired to my account... am I expected to have a computer to hand to log into online banking to retrieve this info? Online banking is also generally very, very poor. Frequent problems with browsers, so I have to have three browsers installed on my computer as I won't know which one works. I've also found that there will often be transactions completely missing from my statements - the only reason I know I've bought something is that I physically have it. This is such a fundamental flaw there is absolutely no way I can trust this bank. Not hard to see how their parent company (RBS) helped facilitate the financial crash in 2009. Bloody useless. "
Customer_1398, Updated Bankline is no good for … , Updated Bankline is no good for business users - the old system was perfect. Now no print options and date selection is unnecessarily clumsy to use. We will be logging out for good if it doesn’t change back! By far the worst is them saying ring this number and report it - that’s your job not mine.  A little customer service might be a good idea 
Customer_1399, Current account switch GUARANTEE ," Used there current account switch service. had nothing but trouble. Had home phone and broadband cut off as unpaid direct debit, also mobile phone service too. called to complain but they said not there fault. Cost over £2 to talk for 20mins to call centre. Someone meant to call me back still waiting "
Customer_1400, Bad experience ," Useless bank...terrible customer service, they took my money and refused to return it fraud team is too rude.. They cut my call and I didn't get my refund. I'm leaving this stupid good for nothing bank.. If you know what's good for you don't bother opening an  account with them or else YOU WOULD REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!! "
Customer_1401, Useless tw*ts , Useless tw*ts! Got a debit card and a credit card with BANK_NAME (this is soon to change). Live chat is totally useless too as anything you ask on live chat they will ask you to call up? I have a standing order setup for the last working day of the month - which i was promised by the agent would be taken on the last working day of the month. However it is always taken before the last working day of the month which sends me in to an unarranged overdraft and i am charged. I have totally given up on trying to get this sorted now. My credit card was blocked for no reason at all - not reported lost/stolen and no where near the credit limit. I wasnt advised of this by BANK_NAME - i was left to find this out myself when i put petrol in my car then couldnt pay for it as my card was blocked. Today is the busiest day of the year for online shopping but i can not use my card and i have been trying to get this sorted via telephone and via live chat all morning but keep getting put through to the wrong departments and given the wrong numbers. Literally at the end of my wits with BANK_NAME. Would NOT recommend and will not be continuing to bank with them. 
Customer_1402, Useless - They don't want your business ," Useless, tried to open a business bank account with them and I'm certain they use racial profiling when opening accounts based on my experience with them. To speak to someone takes 30 mins (they're always busy) and when you do eventually get through you get a useless response and they will you everything will be fine and you get the same emails again the next day saying they still can't open your account. Just to confirm I am already their customer for private banking and it's proving impossible to open a business account - I think they've gone a bit too over the top when it comes to Money Laundering regulations, they should know I'm not a terrorist as they can see I have a personal account with them and I am professional person. I'm now thinking of moving my personal account to First Direct - they're on a different level it's like BANK_NAME = Ford Fiesta vs First Direct = Rolls Royce "
Customer_1403, Useless ," Useless. phoned 3 times today to speak to someone, just got hold music then the chat thing was a waste of time. Because of this a direct debit has come out that shouldn't and it will be too late to reclaim. Shoddy!changing banks. crap service! "

Customer_1409, Very disappointed with BANK_NAME ," Very disappointed with BANK_NAME. They have taken so many charges from me and didnt seem to care when i told them i was already going through a bad time suffering from Cancer. I have also made £30 worth of calls for them to rectify their errors and even though i sent them proof wont refund me.  If you want a good, trusting, helpful bank dont use BANK_NAME! "
Customer_1410," Very disappointed, "," Very disappointed,I have an account for several years, natwes deactivate my phone number several moths ago for no reason and that do not inform me abut that. For last 3 moths, thay just did not inform me about debit or insufficient funds so I can avoid fees and they take more that 60 pounds in total!From my perspective, it look like it was done on purpose to have excuse to still money,Contact with customer service is not resolving anything and complaints are not resolved positively. Avoid this bank!I'm fed up now moving to Metro Bank "

Customer_1414, Visited BANK_NAME Widnes branch today ," Visited BANK_NAME Widnes branch today. Met with Melissa McCoy to discuss obtaining an account. Service from Melissa was exceptional, very helpful, very informative with an affable character and a caring attitude, Melissa even installed the BANK_NAME app on my phone for me. Customer service at its best. Steve Houghton. "
Customer_1415, Do they want customers? , Visited Romsey branch Saturday morning to open an simple account. At 0930 the bank was totally empty so I ask the cashier if I could open an account. I was told that the person had no appointments left so I would have to book an appointment. Since I work in Southampton all week with no easy access to any branch this was not an option. I walked 200yds to Nationwide and despite all the cashiers being busy the branch manager took the time to help me open an account on line using an empty terminal in the front office. Many thanks Nationwide you know how to value your customers. So if you need to open an account go to the Nationwide. 
Customer_1416, Visited the Wigan branch today and was … ," Visited the Wigan branch today and was treated like a criminal. Just wanted to pay a cheque into my son's account which was an inheritance amount, plus £100 cash. I was told as I didn't bank with BANK_NAME myself they couldn't accept the deposits due to money laundering regulations. I was then scolded like a naughty schoolboy (I'm nearly 48) and told by Gareth that he would allow it this time but couldn't give me a receipt! It amazes me that anyone would hand over cash/cheques without getting a receipt as though the bank should be trusted to get the amount right.I went in search of further assistance but was told there wasn't a manager in today and what I had been told was correct - bank rules. I pointed out that the surname of the cheque signatory was the same as the account it was to be deposited to and that surely if they had any reason to suspect fraudulent activity they had an internal team to investigate. Eventually, I was able to deposit the cheque in return for a piece of paper which was stamped, dated and had the amount on. They are not allowed to give me anything with the sort code and account number on even though I had provided them with both in order for the transaction to be completed.The tone and manner of all staff was disrespectful from start to finish and I honestly hope these sad little jobsworths find their branch closed soon and having to wait in line as benefit claimants to experience something approaching the way they treat people themselves. "
Customer_1417, Rude and waste of time ," Wanted to open an account with BANK_NAME. Was sent from branch to branch, all gave me contradicting information. Rude and wasted my time. "
Customer_1418, Was with BANK_NAME for 22 years ," Was with BANK_NAME for 22 years, It took they 6 weeks to transfer a sum of money from a matured fixed term saving accounts to my instant access saving account instead of four days which was in their terms and conditions. After the money was transfer then gave me 60 days before they closed my account. I had three mortgages with BANK_NAME and RBS and they have made over £190,000 just in interest. "
Customer_1419, Absolutely cr** , Wasn't informed about interest rates. 27.5% interest on a loan I took out even though they claim if you have a gold/platinum account you get flexible rates. Called up to complain said I can't complain.. Absolutely useless and the customer service is sh**. If I kneew back when I was opening my account what they were like I wouldn't of touched them with a bargpole. 
Customer_1420, Really bad even by Bank Standards ," We all know they simply would not exist if they were not propped up by the Government.However they still do not get it - they (and the other Banks) are the only ones who do not know that if they are ever to be a viable busineses again they really will have to consider their Customers and try to understand the concept of providing the service to them that they want. Perhaps they could even try asking their Customers what they want).Closing the last Bank Branch in a Town and a complete disregard for what Customers want in day to day Banking and an inability to make Bank Loans or to supply realistic Mortgage Products simply will not do it.But,then again, why am I ranting on - they will take no notice at all! "
Customer_1421, imcompetent and poor customer service and errors that do not breed confidence ," We are a charity and have had a change of staff.  We part bank with BANK_NAME and needed to get the new employee registered with online banking in order to process and run our accounts.  We do not have a Debit card as a  charity account and historically we have  done whats required online and at the branch. When registering we were ensured it would only take a maximum of two weeks.  (It even states this on their website) In reality it took 4/5 months.  We raised complaints, not least because we had hit our financial year end in August and needed to sort out our required accounts and process some transactions. Each time we were given different excuses but each were caused by BANK_NAME.  We had actually filled everything in with a business advisor at our local Branch. They did admit to their errors and promised compensation, as this was costing us money , and delays .  It has caused great problems not having access to our own cash.  We wanted a resolution not an empty promise of Compensation.  To date   No compensation has been  received.  We eventually got internet banking on 24th September despite requesting early June , if not May.  our account was accessed and a transaction made to reimburse our other bank which we had had to rely on, but relates to a different part of our accounts.  Without any notice they rejected the payment and disabled the internet banking. we were referred to ring a particular number, 6 days later which was actually their Fraud team.  It was explained to us that as it was of high value and more than we usually send they had rejected and disabled.  The only reason why it was of a higher value was because it was more than 4 months of transactions, absorbed into the one transaction.  ( BANK_NAMEs Fault) .  regardless of this , it still didn't exceed any of our limits, and in actual fact we have historically withdrawn more.  We used the online support to find out the issue , and was referred to what turned out to be the Fraud team.  The advisor who we dealt with on the online support  was named Masood.  we waited in the queue but once connected with him , he was making us  wait several minutes for each response.  i have to say my query could have been dealt with within a few minutes, but instead it took around an hour.  Every question i asked , he completely avoided and his response would be 'i am sorry you feel like that'.  At one point we even queried with him whether he was going to answer any of my concerns , or just keep avoiding the questions. his response even to this  was, that he was sorry i felt like that, is there anything else i can help you with.  Yes iwas the reply , answer my query!  he also refused to give both his and his managers name.  I only got his first name because it was on screen.  I have to be honest , i think this guy was keen for me to make a complaint. Some of his answers encouraged me to do so.  maybe he is disgruntled with BANK_NAME too.  I think he should get a new job as a wind up merchant.  I cannot have any confidence that BANK_NAME are customer focused ,  care about there image and how they are projected by their staff , and even want to have customers full stop.  They should be taking ownership and trying to resolve their errors.  it may not be a perfect system and issues will always arise, but how it is dealt with can make a huge difference, and customer are centric to its businessMy advise to you is to stay away from BANK_NAME and bank elsewhere.  If you are already with them and you have a concern/issue, do not expect BANK_NAME to even attempt to resolve/indemnify.  Do yourself a favour and save a lot of time and energy, move to another bank "
Customer_1422, 'We are what we do'............. ," 'We are what we do'..........................Lets shut all the local branches so you have to travel miles to see anyone.Thanks, thanks for that.My previous review was 5* but now the Bank is no use to me, I will be leaving. "
Customer_1423, Poor + Bad = Worst Customer Service ," We have been bank's customer for over 2 years now and since opening the account, we had several unfair charges and word service when we tried to question and dispute the charge. I am now so so fed up that I have decided to share my experience with the world. Just a recent experience: On the 29th Feb A customer paid us £120 cash in our business account and informed us, we checked via our online banking and the credit transaction was showing. The money was shown to us as being available to withdraw, so we made an online transfer of £120 assuming that the balance is £120. Now we have received our statement today and at the charges page, they have informed us that they would be charging us a fee of £20 as our account was overdrawn after we  transferred the funds to our other account. The statement shows that the cash of £120 paid by our customer was paid in using a cash point, so the credit was applied the next day. Mind you the amount was added to our balance the same day the customer paid in, so we had no idea that the cash was paid ion using cash point and the money to us was shown as available by the bank. The transaction on the online recent transactions and via app shows Cash Paid In"" that's all the day the payment is made via cash point or in the branch. So there's no way for a business to find out if the money is actually available or not. They then charge customers if they use that money the same day. This is their trick of ""MAKING YOU GO OVERDRAWN""I then rang customer services to discuss the issue and I was told that they can't access my account details and after waiting for a bit"
Customer_1424, Looking to start a business account or move to them? Avoid them like the plague!! ," We have had a business banking account with BANK_NAME since 2011, and a second since 2014, in that time I have had the worst banking experience possible with them. Their customer service teams on the phone are utter morons, I have countless outstanding complaints with them, which they usually decide to forget ever existed after a few weeks (if not immediately after the complaint is made)  and then deny any knowledge of. Constantly having our cards blocked and it is nothing short of a miracle if their antiquated online banking works. Most often it will decide my customer number is wrong (which it isn't) and then block access to the online and telephone banking, or block access to a related account.. because, you know, their staff cant tell the difference between two different limited companies. In the most recent bout of being locked out of one of my companies accounts I was told I could use telephone banking to pay our lease rent. Having paid 2 periods in this manner I receive a final warning letter from our landlord's solicitors claiming that they have not received rent for 3 months, and our lease terms are breached. Guess what? BANK_NAME hadn't bothered processing any of the payments.. but now they cant because my account is locked! (Of course). Currently trying to persuade our landlord that the rent is there to be paid but BANK_NAME have f**ked up paying it and now wont let me access my account, in order to not be evicted. I am in the process of moving our accounts to another banking provider. Unfortunately, within my business acquaintances, the only people whom have any real complaints to make about their banking - are with BANK_NAME. I cannot recommended enough to anyone reading this looking to start a business account or move to them, to avoid them like the plague. "
Customer_1425, The worst company we have ever dealt with ," We have had our first mortgage with BANK_NAME 5 years ago, initial set up went ok but when we asked to port our mortgage without increasing the borrowing or even offered to reduce the mortgage we got declined. In the end we ended up paying nearly 4k early repayment fees to move to another lender. We had no bad credit, both worked full time and earning more than in our initial application a year earlier. We swore to never deal with them again but now we are remortgaging our house our financial advisor said BANK_NAME have good deals at the moment and we thought we'd give things another go. No problem from the credit check point of view but then got our house undervalued by 30k! We have both been buying and selling property for the last 7 years and know our property values. our valuation is very realistic and even low compared to houses that sold in the area for 40k more. Houses of the same size and in good condition like ours (having just spent 35k to renovate it throughout). We have appealed the valuation as the valuers reason for undervaluing was : no comparisons within area. So we sent in comparisons and BANK_NAME business manager agreed that the valuation was ridiculous and sent the appeal through. Only to get a reply today saying that they cannot accept the comparibles because they are not in the same street. I laughed. Just proves what a joke of a company BANK_NAME is. Actually glad as won't have to deal with them again and will know not to ever approach them again "
Customer_1426, I just want to sort out my mortgage!!!!! ," We have had our mortgage with BANK_NAME Bank for 3 years. After our fixed term contract ended, we waited to sort out getting back on a fixed rate as currently we are on variable... However, as much as this SHOULD be an easy process... It's nothing short of a nightmare. We walked into our local branch hoping to sit down with a mortgage advisor to finally get this sorted once and for all. We were told we can't just walk in off the street and do this, and that we would need to book an appointment (ok, not arguing with that) however, you can't book an appointment in branch, you have to ring their dedicated mortgage line to book an appointment. So I ring, and get told the earliest appointment with our local branch is over a month's wait, to be seen on a Monday. Like most people, this doesn't suit either me or my husband because we actually bother to go to work, and work Monday to Friday. When I asked for an appointment on a Saturday, I was told I would have to wait for a call back. So I waited, and waited... nothing! I then had to ring back AGAIN (it's an 0845 number, not 0800)!! expressed my disappointment that I hadn't received a call back, so decided, rather than booking an appointment in branch, I would book a telephone call back to sort it out. The earliest call-back they could offer was over a week and a half later, which I agreed to... to be told, that it would be a half an hour phone call, to wait yet a further 5 working days after that, to receive yet another phone call where FINALLY a mortgage advisor would be able to advise me what mortgage I should have and I can FINALLY get it sorted!!!! What a palaver!!! I just want to sort my mortgage out for goodness sake!!! Think I will just sort my mortgage out online and they can stuff their advice where the sun doesn't shine! BANK_NAME must lose so many customers over this type of thing. Ridiculous. "
Customer_1427," A community bank, gone backwards.. "," We opened a business account here 10 years ago, I've had my mortgage here at BANK_NAME for 13 years, and recentky I moved my two isas here..  18 months ago it was a busy thriving old fashioned bank, fast service, with a good buzz..  Recently they've had a revamp..  Laminate flooring, no glass screens, no privacy for customers, only two open desks and a machine to take your money automatically..  Since then this bank has become the slowest in history, they've already lost two members of staff , and as of this month decided to close two days in the week, one of which is a market day in Garstang..  The staff now seem impatient, unhelpful and frustrated, not much by the way of progress...   Staff aren't happy, customers aren't happy ...   Everything is taking longer..   So where is the progress.?  Someone in an office somewhere has made decisions that have wrecked a good bank..   Now every time I drop in I'm greeted with bad news of increasing charges etc..  Do you want is all to leave..  This bank is terrible...    I regret being talked into coming here..   When I signed up for my isa transfer, I discovered that my customer number had my date of birth as 1956... I was born in 1972, which caused a whole lot of confusion..   Inept...   A bank who's improvements have gone in reverse. "
Customer_1428, STAY CLEAR OF BANK_NAME ," WE PAID A CHEQUE TO OUR NEPHEW WHO HAD A BANK_NAME ACCOUNT. ADMITTEDLY HE'D MADE SOME SERIOUS ERRORS OF JUDGEMENT AND NOT MANAGED HIS ACCOUNT WELL BUT EVEN SO WE WERE SHOCKED THAT DESPITE HIM HAVING AN EXTENSIVE  CLEARED BALANCE THEY REFUSED TO RELEASE HIS MONEY. OUR BANK RANG THEM, WE GAVE THEM THE PROBATE CERTIFICATE, WE WENT AND VISITED THE LOCAL MANAGER AND YET THEY STILL REFUSED TO RELEASE HIS MONEY. THEY THEN ASKED TO SEE OUR BANK STATEMENT. THEY BROUGHT INTO QUESTION NOT ONLY THE INTEGRITY OF OUR NEPHEW BUT ALSO THE INTEGRITY OF MY HUSBAND AND I. "
Customer_1429," Don't touch their loans, they'll drive you to an early grave "," We took out a loan last year, a couple of months later my partner was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, he had to take time off work to have 2 months of intense radiotherapy and chemotherapy without these treatments he would have 3-6 months to live. We went straight to our local branch to explain the circumstances, not only did it not get documented until 8 months later but they have hounded us unsympathetically and sent letter after letter threatening us with bad credit and adding huge amounts of interest, they have driven my partner to attempted suicide because of their unprofessional manner, as if my partners not going through enough, he's under the mental health team and is terrified when the post comes through the door, theyre more bothered about pound signs than my partners health and its disgusting, my partner didnt ask for cancer, theyve made his life even more painful than what it already is, no support just pressure! Because of them hes been on heart monitors and in n out of hospital, please listen n take note they are the most unprofessional unhelpful unempathetic bank going, steer clear! "
Customer_1430, Don't get a mortgage with this people ," We wished to exercise the portable bit of our mortgage, due to issues that were not disclosed the computer said no, however we were offered the option of a paper application dealt with by a human. Seemed senisble as we were reducing the debt and couldnt understand what the problem was.They knew the timescale we  were working to, but kept asking for more information each time delaying the process by 48 hours, had they asked at the start for the information they wanted we could have provided it within 24hours but they kept drip feeding their requests and messed up out entry date twice.

Customer_1431, Stupid systems stupid bank. ," Well having moving from Frauds TSB following the split I've been pretty happy, until it came to ordering a pizza online. Now I'm hungry and just want to order a good pizza online. Now all is fine until I'm prompted to enter my password for my online banking, which WAS 8 characters but oh no they're asking for a ninth character as they seem to know my own password better than I do! So seeing as there was no other options I had to create a new password, 4 attempts later and apparently even passwords that have a combination of names and numbers I've never even thought of before, I've apparently already used.FU BANK_NAME.

Its 8.30 pm BANK_NAME Emergency number (sorry this department is closed)!!!!!I tried customer services to inform them of possible fraud on my account to be told that as i cant remember my pin there is nothing they can do.I offered mortgage details, personal details, every thing that you can think off but the adviser said (computer says NO)I have my mortgage, and gold account with BANK_NAME and have paid for this service for nearly thirty years.  Well BANK_NAME not for much longer i will be moving my business to another high street bank tomorrow. Your customer service is disgusting. All we see from you are empty marketing ploys and an emergency contact department that has to be in business hours. What a total joke, wake up, we are in the twenty first century and fraud is around us NOT just in Business Hours. To all customer dont be be miss guided by all the fancy adverts this bank does not listen or value its customers. Total nightmare. "
Customer_1433, Unhelpful Staff ," Went into the branch on Market Street Manchester to get a photocopy of passport stamped and verified, spoke to one member of staff and the manager Karan Spencer did not want to help. Said they don't do it, which is rubbish because I have had it done before at their Stockport branch. Went round the Corner to BANK_NAME Bank who did it straight away. No problems. What is all this rubbish about becoming UKs most helpful bank. "

The first in Oxford (3 days ago) and then all 3 in Cambridge (in a space of 2 hours).  Each one added a new piece of required information and sent us running around town trying to find a library to print out more documents.  They did not help us in anyway, told us they could not help us with printing.  If you have a foreign address stay far away.  After 30 years of being a customer, I am completely fed up and embarrassed by the awful and inconsistent service and poor knowledge, even by a branch manager. "

Customer_1441, Where do I start? ," Where do I start?Last year we opened a joint bank account and a hard credit search was done twice on my credit file. I called the bank straight away and asked them for this to be resolved. I also told my credit reference agency that I would like to dispute the search. Couple of weeks later BANK_NAME refused to take the second search off my file which was done because of their mistake. Made an official complaint which hasn't got resolved FOR OVER A YEAR NOW! A couple of days ago we decided to cancel our account because we were leaving the country. We went to the Twickenham branch in London and got everything some I'm 15 minutes. Finally, I thought to myself they're improving. We cancelled all our direct debits, standing orders, and the account. The next day when we were already outside the country the first direct debit went out...oh joy!!! Contacted their team and they recalled the payment and advised us that the closing of the account will take 5 working days??? Well... We were certainly not told that! I asked again if now all the direct debits were cancelled? I was told, yes and there will be nothing else going out of our account. 2 days later another payment has gone out. Once again I contacted their team and I was told that this is the account fee for the month before...I asked twice while I was in the branch of everything has been some or if there's anything else we need to pay for, I was told it's all done!! How can a bank afford so many mistakes??? It's absolutely ridiculous. This company is a joke and all customers should stay away from them. As nice their customer service people are they also useless of resolving problems! I'm going to pay for the final fee but I'll make sure my review will be everywhere on the internet to warn people. "
Customer_1442, Wish I could give 0 stars ," Where does one start? So, so bad. Pushed from pillar to post. In queues on the phone, talking to people who can't solve problems. Dealing with problems BANK_NAME created. Endless broken promises to contact us, send letters, phone. Confused and contradictory communications when they do come. All we want now is to close our accounts, and we can't even do that - 8 or 9 months and counting. Can't close an account. You are amazing BANK_NAME: amazingly bad. "
Customer_1443, I will cry writing this I promise ," Where oh where do I start? Everyday banking is fine - their online banking is fine. But try to do ANYTHING that requires help from customer services or ANYONE in a branch and guaranteed, 100% of the time, it will go tits up.The most recent disaster was trying to set up a business account. Was told THREE different things by THREE different people in TWO different branches which meant me running around trying to find extra (and not needed) paperwork, documentation etc. and a delay of a month in even applying for the account (went and did it online in the end), but the whole process took over 3 months. Applied for my account with debit card...Received debit card pin in post. No debit card. Rang them up and they told me I don't get a debit card with this type of bank account (a. business. bank. account.). Ridiculous - I wouldn't have opened it up if I knew I would have to go into the bank to take money out to carry out my business. I told them I had received a pin though and they insisted this must be for another, personal account. I said no, I was looking at it and it was definitely for my business account. They said no, it must be for another account. I must have lost my card or asked for a replacement. I tried my logical approach again, but no, was cut off and told the paper I was looking at, with my business NAME on it was definitely not for this account and that no card had been sent to me. I tried again a few days later and was told, again, that no, I wouldn't be receiving a card. A month ago, and 3 months after opening up the account, I got a business debit card and pin in the post. Tried to activate it via online banking, but it said the card was not recognised. Tried to activate it via SMS and voila - I now have a working debit card for my business banking account. Magic!In the past:1. Once, when I was abroad. I took some money from a cash machine and checked my online banking within the space of about 2 hours on the first day of a 3 week holiday. BANK_NAME cancelled my card on suspected fraud. CANCELLED IT - as in made it redundant and posted me a new card - to my UK address. They also de-activated my online banking as I had logged in from a foreign IP address. I rang them up and they explained they had texted me about it, however I had not received any texts (again, they rudely told me that they had indeed texted me even although I argued that I had not received any text.) I asked them what they suggested I do to access my cash for the next three weeks and they told me I would have to borrow money from someone. Seriously.When I got home, they had sent me the wrong card (a SOLO card!) with a pin number from a card I had about 7 years ago. They told me they had successfully 'upgraded' my account to a Gold account, when actually, they had opened up a new account, running parallel to my current account, but at the same time did not give me any new account number, sort code or new cards (ie so I didnt know I had two accounts). Then they fined me over £100 three months later (and it took them three months to get in touch) because there had been no money in the Gold account to cover the £8 monthly account fee. (They did take off the fine and sort it out)They lost two foreign cheques I tried to put in my account. The cheques ended up paper-clipped together and posted to an address printed on one of them - one of my mother's friends in America. With no explanation, no letter, just two cheques, made out to me, paper-clipped together.  When I first arrived in the UK they told me for a good two years or so that I could not establish credit in this country because my house had bad credit. But no one was able to explain what this meant or what I could do about it. I was young at the time and didn't know either - I did ask, repeatedly, but most of the time they just told me the computer wouldn't let them and to try back in 6 months. So I did. For two years. Until I finally found a woman who worked in the North Audley street branch (who actually had a brain and some sense of agency - most BANK_NAME branch customer service people don't have these, especially in East London). She told me I could apply for a Gold Account (which I did, as above, but unfortunately for me I went back to my Bethnal Green branch to do it). I told her she was the first person to genuinely help me with my banking and she sympathised and told me that 'some people will do anything to get customers to leave.'Tried to open up an internet savings account. Was told that I could only do that in a special branch a mile away and needed to bring all my ID with me. I asked the women if that was necessary since I'm a BANK_NAME customer and she said yes, I did. Got my ID, went to the Branch and was told that there was no need to bring my passport or go to that branch in particular because I'm a BANK_NAME customer. I've had my BANK_NAME credit card for years and years. I rarely use it but decided last year to apply to have the credit limit extended (beyond the £400 it is at now). Was (rudely) told by someone in a branch that I can't do that, the computer wouldn't let them and that I would need to apply for a loan. I was told by someone in another branch that I wouldn't be able to do that 'in the branch you can only take out loans in branches.' I gave up.I could go on. And on. And on. I don't know what BANK_NAME's criteria is for hiring it's public facing staff, but I have never had a good experience. Ever. They simply don't know enough to be able to help in any useful way. The final straw was the move of my business account and credit card to Santander, who are possibly even worse than BANK_NAME. I'm moving banks. "
Customer_1444, where should start. ," where should start.i have a small business loan from them.the loan was ready by 10th of January in an new business account that they opened just for this loan.money is in the account and i have no access to it, why? let me tell you.i called them and asked where is my bank card.did you ordered it, they said.i said when you opened new account you don't send no welcome pack, no pin and no card unless i asked for it? why the hell i opened it for then.they said the default is no card unless you request it.''funny''i ordered it and they said it takes up to 10 working days ( two weeks)i said ok at least activate my online banking i know i still can not transfer money without the card to put it in that stupid card reader to provide some kind of code to setup new transfer but i can transfer money to my other BANK_NAME personal account.they said good idea and tried to setup my internet banking, in the middle of the setup it said that everything is fine i only need the activation cod to send me by letter ""really they still using paper in 2018"" and it only takes 5 working day.another failed attempt to access to the money.i went to the brach to transfer it manually to my personal account.i asked to transfer 10k.after filling 10 pages to prove that i am not a terrorist or in contact with any of them and no one asked me to do so and have 20 min interview with the manager of the branch to confirm to transaction i have some of my loan in to my account 10 days after i actually get the loan.1 week passed still no card nor the pin "" surprise "" but i have my activation cod. two of them actually. send me 2 letter with 2 different activation code. however none of them works and the online banking couldn't recognise the codes and said the code has to resend and it takes another week to have it.so damn unnecessary extra steps to do a simple task.i could go online with BANK_NAME bank in just 10 minutes and santander bank was the same. you can get online and have access to your account in matter of  minutes.i have another account with them which i stoped using it for almost same reasons and after i moved my house 8 years ago and after i notify them by phone, fax,letter and in the branch they still send some of my letter to that address. i am lucky that my friend lives there.avoid this bank as far as you can.

Customer_1445, Whilst on holiday in France Intermarche … , Whilst on holiday in France Intermarche supermarket took over £120 in error out of my account leaving me borrowing money from friends to get back home. BANK_NAME did everything they could to help especially Laura Johnson in complaints.After 9 days she gave me £40 to tied me over as compensation and today I've received a beautiful bouquet of flowers. It's Saturday and I've received the money back that was wrongly taken from my account with no fault of BANK_NAME.I'd like to say a big thank you to BANK_NAME 
Customer_1446, Why is it so hard to transfer your own … ," Why is it so hard to transfer your own money, you get locked out of your account and it's then unlocked but then you need an activation code for your card reader, even though you've passed security and answered all the questions under the sun.Utter waste of time, on hold and a useless member of the customer service team. Advised I wanted to close the account down, no acknowledgement at all from the person on the phone. Absolute joke, don't mind charging me fees every month or letting me put in large sums of money, but when I want to transfer it I either have to wait 5 working days for a code to materialise or physically go into a branch.

Customer_1447, Had Funds in Bank Still put me Overdrawn ," Will never use these con artists again had no issues for the first 18 months of having my bank account but since all the mess ups at there end with wages being paid in late, bank cards not working in chip and pin readers things are not so good for me as a customer.I bought some items off ebay. I transfered money from my joint account and was 100 percent certain the funds was in the account otherwise i wouldnt of bought the items, about a week i get a text message from BANK_NAME saying ive gone over my agreed limit pay in by 2pm to avoid charges. I logged onto online banking to find they have put me £40 over drawn without any explanations and no apolgises also no offer of investigationphoned customer service which after explaining whats gone on they  reversed the charges without arguements but then put me in a negative balance on paypal which ive never had before so i had to settle that with paypal straight away now in a dispute about where my monies gone as im now £40 out of pocket actually got my items from ebay so the monies gone somewhere but had to pay the £40 to paypal after BANK_NAME put me overdrawn even shows on my bank statement they came out from the point of me adding the £40 to them taking it out whilst in credit to then adding £40 of there own chargesbad bank, bad customer service and poor system they have running not suprising really being part of RBS.This bank will get you into trouble avoid at all costs now changed to nationwide and took the account from BANK_NAME with mewould never use them again "

Customer_1449," Staff treated badly, customers tolerated. Misleading marketing. "," Worked for them for 2 years and only got an account as they force you to. Since then I have been disappointed with pretty much everything they have done (or more regular not done).  They seem to be set up to overly prevent fraud, but they end up just preventing you from doing your regular banking. Just changing my address has taken months and multiple visits to the branch. My internet banking is still frozen out and I have given up trying to sort that out. I just rarely use the account these days. Would recommend people avoid unless absolutely necessary. "

Customer_1451," 8 weeks and many calls ,emails, later new account still not open !!! "," Worst bank ever, they really deserve the title , even after numerous calls I don't know the status of my application for opening a new company business account, I made an appointment with the southeast London business team manager and gave all the requested paperwork and filled in all paperwork in the two hours I was with her , and was told it'll be up and ready in a few days, two weeks later I email her from the business card she gave me and would you believe it, it bounces back with an automated reply saying this email is no longer in use!!!, so why give me fake contact details???I have no direct contact number so you go through the usual call centre number who then either hang up or listen to you asking for your new account details and then say the lady is still on sick leave or holiday or someone will call you in the next 4 hours and guess what, I am still waiting for that call 3 weeks on and numerous other promises later!!And when their staff go on leave or on sick , apparently they don't hand over anything to anyone else still at work so the customer is just left waiting with no response whatsoever , one person tells me she is back on Tuesday and will contact me , the next person tells me she is on holiday, the next tells me she is back to work!!They won't even give you the correct email address for her, repeating the old non working email address and saying that even though the auto reply says that it's not in use, the account opening team manager still receives it apparently!!But if that is the case why do I not get any response back ???Either they don't know what they're doing or no one in their IT department quite knows how to get their email system to work.Seriously the worst bank ever, each person who responds to your call makes all sorts of promises , the manager will call you or so and so will email you and take all your details down and then , absolutely nothing happens!!! Avoid like the plague, and if neat west is remotely interested, I have the saga fully catalogued!If they're like this before you've even opened an account , I can't imagine what they'll be like if I actually had an issue to resolve post opening!!!

Customer_1453, utterly useless. , worst bank in the world . terribly rude staff 
Customer_1454, Worst Customer Service Ever ," Worst customer service ever. the BANK_NAME teams have no communication, meaning one needs to explain the issue over and over again.

Customer_1456, Would not recommend ," Would not recommend! Tried to open a joint account with BANK_NAME.  Took time out on a Sunday for an appointment.  Wrong information was put into the system. Had to go back into the branch and waste another hour of my time, take paperwork home to re-sign, then go back in the next day and drop off.  Chased to see where the matter was up to several times over the next few weeks (emailed the BANK_NAME contact direct) and was told it was being dealt with and chased.  As time wore on, I emailed to find out what was going on with the application.  I received a reply a few days later to say that as the matter was now past 30 days, I would have to re-apply!!  No thank you!  Complete and utter waste of my time. "

Customer_1458, Wow. Totally and utterly useless ," Wow, how bad can 1 banks customer service be? I am treasurer for a boys footy club so have a community account.I have spent 2 months trying to get online access. I have spent over 2 hours in branch, this doesn’t include the time actually queuing to speak to someone. I have made numerous telephone calls. I have repeatedly left messages to be called back, receiving a call back on the third time of asking. I have had to resubmit forms, take in additional ID. I’m still not online, although apparently, I will be in 10 days!  I’ve given them 1 star for being polite and courteous although I’d rather have put up with brusque yet efficient. Fortunately, this is just a small community account, had I been running a business, goodness knows the effect it would have had. "

Customer_1461, Zero stars ," Zero stars; if I could.I hold financial Power of Attorney for my disabled sister who is going through a nasty divorce. Firstly, the local branch would not recognise the LPA despite it being sealed by the court of protection. I once spent over an hour on the telephone being transferedaround to try to prevent her account being drained of funds by her husband.. to no avail despite my sister confirming security. Six letters of complaint to the branch manager were ingnored. A tip here; If you write to the branch manager the letter will not go to him at all, it is taken to a central location to be dealt with......except it is not dealt with! In short staff are not well trained, they have a bad attitude and are unhelpful....even if you are disabled and need help or advice. All in all BANK_NAME are rubbish...try a different bank! Once we are sorted, BANK_NAME/RBS (same group) will be loosing 15 accounts from my family! "
Customer_1462, Worst bank ever ," 1) Rejected to open an account for my partner even that my partner has excellent credit score. They made passport and other document copies and then rejected... After while I went to the bank and while I was waiting in the queue I have noticed a pile of documents freely lies close to the entrance on the floor and of course copy of my partner's passport was on top of it -  Yes, sounds like I am lie, and even I would not believe anyone telling that to me but truth is truth - so customer data is free accessible on floor and on top of that all they kept documents of my partner without permission as she does not have account there... Breaking law twice!2) Silver account is totally useless as it costs 9.95 a month for Europe travel + phone insurance + AA breakdown ... there are much better offers from other banks...3) Queues if you need to go bank are massive - it takes in average around 45 minutes...4) Mortgage percentages are too high - When I did quote it was one of  highest percentages on the market and they not really bothered about helping you out at all...5) Other offers for example car insurance and house insurance - they must be joking....6) Rumours - that this bank has the weakest security ever... I don't know if it is true but time to time it makes me stress :/I am the customer since 2008 and now looking for switching banks... Hope it just me having this all trouble with them... Good luck in your bank huntings... "

HELLO ? The fraudster has stolen my debit card data somewhere and now it is legit for him to withdraw any amount from my account ?3.) BANK_NAME sold me a incapacity insurance policy, I had a bad accident and broke my backbone/spine. Thought I could make it back to work so I made my claim late after having been sick for many months. BECAUSE I made the claim so late they said, I am not entitled to the insured £ 2.500 any more but only £ 963 per month now ... at least that got paid ... pityful4.) Receiving a sum from abroad, although I got everything right, the sender made a mistyoe in the recipient line of the international payslip (caus of bad eyesight) - BANK_NAME refused to credit my account because although bank account number, sort code and address are correct there is a little mistype in my surname (1 letter !) and now they have to return the money to the sender.

The service has been awful - they need so much information and nothing is ever good enough.

Customer_1467, 1 month - still no account! , Absolutely pathetic service. Everything is done via snail mail and one letter at a time with a 5working day wait on it. It's been one month and I still have not even received everything to open my account. They also FORGOT to send my documents through to head office and pretty much closed my application for two weeks. It wasn't until I chased it up a few weeks later that they realised some body messed up big time. But still as above its been a month and no account and no access to money.

So I plan to close all accounts with them and go to Metro bank and Halifax. 
Customer_1470, Absolutely the worst bank ever , Absolutely the worst bank ever. No customer service and no humanity.

They simply DO NOT CARE!I used them for 20 years and make considerable money and they STILL treated like a moron. I will never deal with BANK_NAME again. I have moved all 5 accounts I have to another bank and the service is amazing. I forgot after 20 years of neglect service exists in the banking industry. DO NOT USE THIS BANK! 
Customer_1471, Dishonest & Incompetent BANK_NAME Banking Staff In the Customer Complaints Team ," Account Reference: 11320567I am experiencing the following issue: I have been calling the out of hours team since my initial complaint on the 1st of October in Gran Canaria. I have been dealt with diabolically so far spoken to several people who have transferrred me to the Halifax? I have screen shotted all of my calls totalling over 5hours most of which occured in the canaries, i have been called a liar and a thief by complaints managers, had not one call returned. I have submitted payment to have my bank account notes released as i was advised there are offensive comments being left by your employees. We are now on the 20th october and nobody seems capable other than hanging up on me, terminating my calls, issuing me with final warnings, all the calls have been listened to, i called again last night and spoke with Luke Sanders who agreed the treatment was disgusting but then told me my attitude would not be tolerated and terminated my call. If i have attitude it is because i can prove your employees are no adequately trained have failed to deliver on assurances of call back then Luke refused to cover the cost of last nights call saying i was offered the option of a call back - in fact every call you listen to I have been assured a call back and it has to date never happened, therefore i chose not to believe this and stayed on the line and waited. I think it is perfectly understandable not to believe i would recieve a call back when you have listened to all of the calls.To action this I would like you to I would like you to train your staff sufficiently, inform them that customers can record all calls also and prove that they are dishonest and inform them leaving derogatory comments on a customers notes is not acceptable and only antagonises the situation further, if they had any common sense they would realise that we can obtain copies of all notes and comments recorded.I look forward to a response within 7 days of this correspondence.Please reply to my resolver email account as I would like to keep all of my communications in my personalised complaints case file.Yours faithfullyGary Whitehill I have forwarded you an email this morning in relation to last nights call with Luke Saunders. As stated in my earlier email with the call charges from calling you abroad three times for over four hours in total obviously had an effect on my data package, whilst I have to accept you still think me dishonest and a thief please see the above which will highlight along with the other screenshots you are in receipt of proving I am neither.

Customer_1472, After 40 years I have decided to leave BANK_NAME Bank. ," After 40 years of being a current account holder with BANK_NAME Bank I have now decided enough is enough. I have become, over recent years, more and more demoralized with the banks behavior towards its customers. After the recent banking scandal you would have thought that their senior management would have made every effort to keep their existing customers whilst trying to attract new clients to the bank. Instead, they are now closing more branches whilst trying to discover new ways of adding additional charges to their existing customers accounts in order to recoup their losses. My recent experience has been the last straw.For no apparent reason whilst making a payment to HMRC for car tax, my debit card payment was refused because of possible credit fraud. I can accept that nowadays on the internet security is paramount, however, the BANK_NAME notice which advised this refusal stated they would ring in 5 minutes or you could contact them on 0845 604 5603. Needless to say no call received and when you ring their quoted number you get an automated system which doesn't resolve the matter. Finally after 45 minutes and searching the net as to which number to call, you finally get through to their fraud department who have no idea as to why your card was refused even though their page advised you to quote category C5. I asked what would have happened if I was aboard and my card was refused and their response was that I should advise them prior to all foreign travel. What a lot of nonsense. Their systems are not fit for purpose and in my opinion their management need to reduce their TV advertising and spend those resources and fixing their internal systems. "
Customer_1473, overdraft fees ," After a change of circumstances, my partner having an accident at work, i struggled financially, i looked to my overdraft for help stupidly and managed to borrow over a period more than twice my income. BANK_NAME allowed this. upon receiving the information regarding change of overdraft fees, my account has become unmanagable, my fees have gone from around 40£ a month to 115£. BANK_NAME have been quoted on moneysupermarket to say they can help customers based on their individual circumstances. This is a lie. I held my account for 12 years. They have told me there is nothing they can do for me. Watch this space BANK_NAME, i will pay off my overdraft and i will close my account. Dissapointed. "
Customer_1474, After a fraudulent letter in the post … ," After a fraudulent letter in the post and over an hour on the phone they couldn't clarify if it was a legitimate letter or a fraudulent letter.

My online banking then got froze without any request to do so or being informed that would be the case. The security number i was supposed to see in the post to retrieve my online banking never arrived.Three phone calls, hour twenty on the phone not one answer given. Requested the staff had more staff training. Removed all funds & savings from my accounts and moved to a different bank. "
Customer_1475, Awful Card Protection Service CCE ," After buying a vehicle which was promised full service history on my credit card I had to initiate a chargeback after 3 months due to the merchant lying through his teeth about the vehicle having it , I spent days preparing all the paperwork to email off , after I sent it off I had a letter saying case closed as they called the merchant and he said he has the service history there for me to uplift ( 4 months after the vehicle was purchased ) I tried to explain that this is a lie and can you try to enforce the delivery of the documents promised at the point of sale , they refused point blank and said due to the merchants statement on the phone the case is closed , I am now in the process of starting a formal complaint so I can then take it to the FOS once the complaint is processed Anyone with a shred of common sense would of saw through the car dealers lies about him having the service history at the garage ready for me 4 months after the vehicle was purchased , I think they look to do the minimal amount of work involved in investigations "
Customer_1476, Very bad customer service ," After taking a complaint to BANK_NAME from receiving a completely incorrect product to which I ordered, I was assured by the staff in branch it would get sorted and I would receive money back or a replacement product, I was then contacted by the team saying they needed a full write up of what they sent to what I received, I then got a phone call telling me they had received it an I had to get proof the product was a fake, but I could not get through to them even with the picture document I had sent that I didn't care if the product was fake or not, that it just wasn't what I ordered, after this I assume they threw my case away as I have not heard anything for months now, very bad customer service and very let down by my bank. "
Customer_1477, Feel like I've been punished ," After working away all week I log on to the bank to find my credit limit on my BANK_NAME card had been reduced to half with no explanation. As I pay my balance in full every month, have a really good job and pay my bills on time I was a little baffled so decided to call the bank. I then received the worst possible customer service and was told that I was notified of the change and it couldn't be reversed. I hung up and then the postman turns up with a letter from BANK_NAME the contents of which I can only describe as aggressively reducing my credit limit. There was however a really helpful paragraph in the letter stating that I could reject the change in limit by exercising my right to cancel my agreement with BANK_NAME by paying off the balance and closing my credit card account which I have just done! :) Thanks for the good advice BANK_NAME I will heartily recommend to my friends and professional colleagues to exercise their right not to spend money with you in the future. Not quite sure what I did to offend them so much! "
Customer_1478, Refreshing ," all of the keyboard warrior people below stating BANK_NAME - i have not a bad word to say, the online Banking & App are easy to use and responsive, and do not require a degree in IT to figure out... I called them yesterday for a query, i was dealt with quickly,  the customer service agent was almost too polite.. if that's a thing. I have recently moved from Think Money: which if you are unfamiliar is essentially like scraping the bottom of a sludgy barrel when it comes to banks / service / and reliability.... so to me BANK_NAME is a breath of fresh air.

Questioned about why i have so much cash in front of the whole bank and making me feel like a criminal, to pushing me off the pay in machine for another customer of hers because i had to much cash (which the machine dislikes when creased yes???), struggling to pay it in. Asked not to count money in front of her because she was busy and dislikes it, claiming it is policy not to allow the counting of money at the counter.. Unhelpful management who advise online banking instead as a resolution. So i can deposit cash online yes.??. The beauty would be that useless employees such as yourselves, would be jobless.. "
Customer_1484, BANK_NAME ABOLISH HIGH & LOW BALANCE TEXT ALERTS !!!! ," ANOTHER REDUCTION IN CUSTOMER SERVICES - BANK_NAME no longer offer customers what was a very useful High & Low Balance Text Alert Service. While still charging their current account customers £3 per month, for each current account, they have reduced their services to their current account customers for no reason, other than it benefits the bank to no longer provide these High & Low Balance Text Alerts in two ways. Firstly, customers whose accounts that receive a credit, that then results in their balance exceeding the maximum interest earning current account balance of £5000, no longer get a Text Alert advising them that their balance is above a set amount. This means that BANK_NAME can now sit on any excess balance amount over & above the £5K limit without alerting their customers. BANK_NAME then benefit from this, as they retain additional monies but pay no interest on it. Previously, when customers were sent a High Balance Text Alert, they had the option of moving the excess balance to a savings account, where it would earn interest. Now with no High Balance Text Alert, customers are left oblivious of any excess monies in their current accounts. Secondly, with the abolition of Low Balance Text Alerts, customers will no longer be informed when a debit on their account takes their balance below the £5K interest earning limit. This means that BANK_NAME then only have to pay interest on a lower balance amount, again increasing their profits. This is nothing short of a BANK_NAME banking scam; reducing services simply to increase their profit margins at their customers' expense. Not content with numerous branch closures that cause pain & grief to millions of their customers, this abolition of High & Low balance Text Alerts is just another Bankers"" iniquitous greed deed by BANK_NAME.

Customer_1501," Had quite a few problems recently, which has led me to leave "," Been with BANK_NAME for about 6 years (current account, mortgage, credit card and savings), over the last 6 months had some poor experiences which has led be to transfer away my accounts:- Mysteriously sent my new debit card to an address I haven't lived at for 5+ years, so was without a card for almost two weeks. Spoke with customer services over the phone about where my new card was and they confirmed it had been sent to old address, and I needed to go into a branch to update my address. Even had the cheek to say I must have forgotten to change it, even though I explain to them they had been sending letters to me for 5 years for 5 different accounts to my current address. Anyway had to go into a branch, changed my address back and asked for an explanation on how this could have happened. After about 30 mins of various staff input I was just told it must have been a computer glitch that caused it, they could see an entry on my details showing my address had just switched back to an old one a few months back (scary)- Bought a new house and got a new mortgage. New mortgage provider wanted to see some bank statements to confirm something (been paperless and online banking for years, so don't have any), I had to provide them same day for various reasons. Went online to print the statements off, but for some reason the pdf would not print with the logo and top summary details (mortgage company wouldn't accept this as a valid bank statement). Went to the nearest BANK_NAME branch and explained I needed a printed copy of my last two statements urgently and was told this is something they couldn't do in a branch.- Never used a cheque in a long long time but I had too recently to pay a Council Bill to a department that would only accept cheques. I probably had a cheque book at some point but no idea where. Was in a situation where I needed to hand in the form + cheque to the Council same day, so went into the nearest BANK_NAME branch to get them to make me out the two cheques I needed from my account. I was told I needed to pay £20 per cheque for this service, basically for 10 seconds work and a small piece of paper. Being charged £40 to get money out of my account, when I was only trying to pay £90. Ended up ordering a new cheque book instead which took 10 days to come (even though the bank said half that), so got a friend to write me a cheque after 5 days.- Tried to make a new online fast payment but the system wouldn't let me setup the transfer, normally would just try again later but really needed to transfer the money. The error message that came up said Please ring xxxxx number or go into a branch"""

Avoid at all costs "
Customer_1504, Bit Of A Bumpy Start - Faults signing up online ," Bit of a bumpy start with BANK_NAME Bank but I decided to give them another chance.It started Mid April (2015) where my bank had to close my account down temporarily when I had it cleared out by fraudsters, and I was left without money for a while and thought that it might be a good idea to set up an account with a second bank so that I would have some emergency money at least, so I decided to sign up for BANK_NAME as I liked the idea of their cashback offers.I signed up online and the sign-up process was easy but I noticed a small mistake with my address but there wasn't a way for me to change this but I just assumed they'd be able to correct it on their end, and after pressing submit I'd completely forgotten about the address coming up slightly wrong.As soon as I submitted the information, I was emailed to say I needed to show some identification in branch so I did this a few days later where the man working in branch scanned my passport and driving licence, stamped it and said everything should be up and running within ten days, although ten days passed and I'd heard nothing. A few days after that I got a text saying I needed to go into branch and show my documents so I did this and the guy working there just said that it's a rare occurrence but sometimes errors like this do happen, he sent those off and then a few days later I got this same text again, so the same man was there phoned up a specific department who told him to fax my ID over and they would process it there. But a few days later I just got an email saying I was unsuccessful in signing up. It didn't explain why and I was actually really annoyed and a little bit concerned my details had been lost somewhere and/or stolen by thieves just like my other details.I emailed the complaints department just explaining I was a little concerned that my details had been leaked and told them I'd now gone elsewhere with my banking. This was Thursday evening and I received a phone call Friday morning from the department, the man there assured me that my details won't have been leaked out and he wasn't sure what had actually gone on but he apologised for everything and was a little disappointed that I moved my banking elsewhere or else he would have tried booking me an appointment within the bank, and I said it wasn't too late and he could still do that and he did. He also gave me £50 compensation for the trouble.Anyway I visited branch giving BANK_NAME a second chance and everything seemed to go more smoothly. It was a little longer than if online had have worked, but certainly more easier signing up because I was able to actually talk to the lady signing me up and ask questions so I was grateful for the opportunity really. I also figured out what had happened with everything failing with the online sign up..I live in a village called Gildersome, and my house number is 34. I won't include my street name but for some reason when I signed up it said I lived at 34 Gildersome, and this was the other address that came up when I did sign up online and that I completely forgot about happening. So anyway, the lady asked me if I still lived at 34 Gildersome? And I told her no but realised that's what happened online, because this wasn't my address so the address on my identification wasn't matching with my profile with them, but anyway she corrected it and everything went smoothly. She also got her manager to come in at the end of the interview just so he could clarify his staff were doing well and I didn't realise that the branch manager was actually the guy who was helping me when I was coming into branch with ID, he couldn't stop apologising and was glad that things were finally sorted out. He told me I wasn't the only customer having trouble signing up online.I just had one slight more problem though but isn't a massive deal, when signing up she promised I would receive a contactless card and when it arrived it wasn't contactless so I was a little disappointed. I know it seemed a little daft but I find them so useful so I phoned up the cards department and explained everything, the first guy I spoke to didn't seem best pleased to be talking but the second guy he passed me over to was very polite and helpful and said he'd placed one on order for me and it should be with me within five days so I just hope that is fixed for me now and then I'll finally be happy after over a month of trying to register! So overall I have a feeling I'm going to be happy banking with BANK_NAME in the long run, but I'm just annoyed that it's taken over a month to get me signed up "
Customer_1505, Debit card dispute mega fail ," Bought a couple of clothes worth £100 from a shop on Facebook. One of them didn't arrive, tried to contact the seller but they didn't answer and they also blocked me. I called BANK_NAME and raised a dispute. I was more than happy to find out they were willing to help. Sent them all the information, the communication I had with the seller asking to return the item that arrived (very poor quality) and  to find out what was going on with the other one and they said they will investigate and call back. That didn't happen so I called again and they said they need more information from me (the same info I already gave them). Sent them the info again although a very hard thing to do as they have firewalls that block most things with an attachment (understandably). I did the same thing again once more until I ran out of patience. Everytime I called them they were telling me something different. Not only they did not help but I also waisted hours calling and chasing and it was all for absolutely nothing. I will call them to close my account as I do not trust they have any sort of coordination to guard my money safely. "

She changed the details on the system and confirmed same. The change was obviously reversed or blocked.Card reader then packs up. I call the call centre they say order online and it will take 7-10 days for delivery. When you rely on internet banking you cannot even check your balance without a card reader. ""Solution""...says the call centre - ""you need to go into a branch to do any banking or find out your balance"". Voila..more time wasting!NOW 5 weeks later..no card reader and no address change!! Called the call centre again. Card reader was sent out to the old address. I go to the old address 30 minutes drive either way..no card reader! I call the call centre once again...they re-order a card reader and told me it will be delivered in 7-10 days AND I must complete a form off the internet"

Answered said questions (without multiple choice).... mortgage provider, maiden name (well, another name I have been known by) and my age on my next birthday. Funnily enough, I didn't pass security and she told me after making me wait for 21 mins on the phone on an 0845 number, that I now had to go to a bank with my photo ID. Furious!! Plus the fact she didn't seem bothered to help or explain things to me after this point and repeated the same phrase she was obviously being shown to say on her computer. Round 2:Phoned back 20 seconds later.... and spoke to GEORGE. Again, went through security and answered three questions from my credit file (this time got the option of multiple choice, WHAT?). Funnily enough, my mortgage provider (same as Round 1), my maiden name (well another name i have been known by, but same as round 1) and now name someone I live with (different question). I passed and my online banking was unlocked! When I mentioned to him about the phone call with Eddie before (not being able to get into my account with the same two questions as this time and no multiple choice) he then says he shouldn't have allowed my online banking account to be opened (even though he got me to log in and check it worked, and it did!), because I had spoken to Eddie before, suspended it again and asked me to go into branch with ID.In the words of Nan What a load of old......BANK_NAME"" Now i've been with BANK_NAME (hate to say) for 25 odd years"

They would not budge even though I complained and hounded me by phone, text and letter, threatening a debt collection agency within days. I would never insure with this company again and now that they have changed their arrangements for text alerts I am consider moving my other accounts also as when I threatened to do so they were not in the least interested. Appalling disinterested customer service. "
Customer_1525, Con artists who tell blatant lies , Do not trust anyone working for this company. I've been lied to and deceived into various traps that caused me to get into a lot of debt and caused a lot of damage to my life. 
Customer_1526, terrible service ," Don't even touch this bank, just tried sorting my online banking over the phone which costs a bomb,Well what a waste of time didn't get anywhere plus sounded like she wanted to go home. Going to leave this horse manured bank and go somewhere else! "
Customer_1527, Dreadful experience at Accrington … , Dreadful experience at Accrington branch for my son with bipolar disorder. Awful unhelpful staff. His wallet and card were stolen and even though my son took his passport to the branch he was refused his money from his account. The female employee concerned was rude and had a very unhelpful attitude. This resulted in my son shouting at the lady concerned who then closed his account without informing him until too late to try and obtain another bank account elsewhere for his direct debits and bills. This lady has caused him and myself a great deal of stress trying to sort another account out. She needs lessons in how to genuinely help and talk to customers. However that said the staff at the Driffield branch in Yorkshire have been very helpful in comparison. I would not recommend the Accrington branch at all and to be avoided 
Customer_1528, Easily the worst customer service I've … ," Easily the worst customer service I've come across in my entire life. It's now been over a week that we lodged a complaint about the brand new air conditioner not working, but the response has been far from mediocre. Somehow, Lloyd tends to think we're all a bunch of housewives sitting at home and waiting for their servicemen on their candid response We can't inform you when we'll come"
Customer_1529, Being charged and not even knowing , End of every month like everyone we pay money in to nit get charge a fee if going over your limits in this case i had no clue that BANK_NAME bank were charing me 1£ every day fir the last month cheers BANK_NAME you work wonders with youre customers thats why we love you Please do not open an accout with BANK_NAME there useless...... 
Customer_1530, Impersonal ," Engaging with this bank is an incredibly frustrating experience. Most companies today realise the importance of investing in their customer experience and retaining the loyalty of their customers but BANK_NAME seem to think it's ok to treat you as a stranger in every conversation and behave as though they are the only bank in the world. BANK_NAME need to urgently wake up to the fact it is the age of the consumer and if they don't deliver an expected level of service or fail to treat customers respectfully, they will walk away. I have and will not be looking back. "
Customer_1531, Fraud team is a waste of time. ," Every time I try to make a purchase on line my payment is always stopped by the fraud team, and I have to contact them too prove it is me making the transaction every time, it has now got to the point that there is no point in buying anything online anymore, I have been with BANK_NAME for years  I complained to my local branch in Dereham, and there answer was not our problem you need to contact the fraud team and sort it out with them I have contacted the fraud team several times over the last two months been to my branch twice told it will not happen again, tonight it happened again I was unable to buy something from Argos.There is no point in having a debit or credit card if this is happening every time. the only option for me is to change to a different Bank.We did not have this problem until the fraud department started doing this two months ago.Another loyal customer that you say you want to keep, moving somewhere else.Goodbye BANK_NAME you deserve it. for being unhelpful and rude to your customers. "
Customer_1532, I have been a BANK_NAME customer all my life. I'm very saddened by the way they treat 'loyal' customers. , Extortionate bank charges and refusal to increase measly overdraft to avoid charges. All the while offering me £6000 credit card! Some months my charges have exceeded £100. I have a perfect credit rating so absolutely no reason why I shouldn't have a small overdraft to avoid massive charges. They claim to be a responsible lender. I don't think so. Ombudsmen now involved and after 40 years I am taking me custom elsewhere. 
Customer_1533, Fraud facilitated by BANK_NAME ," Fails to protect business account holders from fraud.Despite reporting a fraud by Ranee James who was opening accounts with various institutions at my address they are alone in failing to act on this information and shut down the account and stop sending correspondence.  All other banks did so at the first time of reporting.I have been into BANK_NAME branches on 4 separate occasions, made numerous phone calls and returned post to them yet still the letters, threats and harassment continues.Now off to cause the biggest scene ever in branch.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. "
Customer_1534, Ordering online is a struggle with BANK_NAME due to the Clicksafe system they have , Fed up of BANK_NAME. Every time i order something on the internet. The stupid Click safe system intervenes and its always 50/50 on whether it's going to let the order go through or not.Trying to speak to them on the phone is a nightmare.You can't change your address on the internet. You have to send a letter to their head office... It's like going back in time. 
Customer_1535, deliberately deceptive ," finished paying off a fixed loan agreement only to find out the last payment is higher than expected, BANK_NAME bank inform me that if your payment falls over a weekend your payment is taken on the next available working  day accruing extra interest  this was never mentioned on my application feel ripped off "
Customer_1536, A very poor and inflexible attitude towards customers ," First time I've had to call the bank in years, as my debit card had stopped working. Got asked a few security questions, which one would expect. But then got told I'd answered something wrong. Turns out they had the wrong address on my account, yet I get new cards arriving ok and my mortgage is with them, so the correct address is on their system. So I was very puzzled to be told they couldn't verify who I was. So, that was that, computer says no. The Scottish woman at the contact centre just wanted to hang up on me as she'd run out of script. Hugely frustrating that they're incapable of adapting their security protocol and also for asking such stupid questions. I could tell them the date and time of every transaction on my account. So I end up having to drive to the nearest branch and sort it out. Which because they've closed most where I live, meant a 40 minute drive and then had to wait ages as they had one person on during the lunch period. The one time they're likely to be the busiest. Not impressed at all and I'm going to change because of all this. I've hd an account with them for 30 years and God knows why I've not changed, considering how they reward loyalty... "
Customer_1537, Worst  bank in the world and worst customer service in the world , For such a big bank BANK_NAME have no good customer service not even there mangers knows what they doing some times am on the phone to them for more than 2 hours making my house phone very high each month and I have no choice but to call up they don't respect there customers and always hanging up Please please if you know what's good for you don't bank with BANK_NAME am leaving them I have been fruded so many times because of them Hate them they Need to be CLOSED DOWN 
Customer_1538, Refuse online supermarket shop weekly , For the last 3 months ever week when I do my online supermarket shop BANK_NAME flag it up as fraudulent activity. I then spend most of my Sunday trying to get BANK_NAME to sort it out (they refuse to ring you back). I've currently been on hold for 1 hour and 35 minutes. Go to any other bank but DON'T GO TO BANK_NAME. 
Customer_1539," No access to my money while I'm abroad, would give 0 stars if possible. "," For work, I live outside of the UK about half the year. Now, I've moved away and will not be back in the UK for about 4 months. I wanted to transfer some money into my current (local) bank account -- but they won't let me. I've spend so much time (and money, in overseas calling credit!) trying to get access to my own money.. But the only way they say they can fix this is if I show up, in person, at the branch where I opened my account. Which is impossible for me at the moment (unless they're willing to refund my flights to the UK...) Terrible service, stupid attitude of the help desk, and no word of explanation of WHY this is happening. I find this completely unacceptable, as because of this I will actually need to borrow money to pay rent and get food. I will most definitely change banks as soon as I am back in the UK, and will not be coming back to BANK_NAME. "
Customer_1540, Fraud happened on my account in 2015 ," Fraud happened on my account in 2015.  Unauthorised transactions via debit card.  On the day I found out, I made 17 phone calls to the bank.  Nothing was done.  The fraud continued.  Two days later I got through to the fraud department, and immediately after completing security the phone was put down on myself.  The fraud continued.  I made a lot of calls to them during this period about the situation.  But nothing was done, and the fraud continued.  I had one woman, when I asked her to cancel the direct debit card and issue a new one, say that she was not going to do what I want in case I complained about her doing what I was asking for"" - figure that out.  I had one from Scotland tell me that I was obnoxious among other things.  Only to be later shame faced  when I had yet again gone through their security process to only be refused again.  He said in a much lowered voice ""I know"" when I told him that I had been refused again.  The trouble is that they kept on saying I needed to go through security for them to deal with the situation"
Customer_1541, FRIENDLY AND HELPFULL BANKING ," Friendly staff, issues resolved in minutes, great service & definitely a recommendable place for banking. "
Customer_1542, Dreadful Bank - worst of the bunch ," Gave me a settlement figure on my account. It was wrong. Trying to get through to them was almost impossible as they closed my account and my number no longer worked. They are rude, unhelpful and hide behind their automated systems. What's the point of complaining - they are too big and I am a tiny fish in their pond. Use Nationwide as they don't have shareholders. No wonder the CEO goes off work with stress - try being a customer it is far worse stress. "
Customer_1543, Go on my account to receive a message … ," Go on my account to receive a message that I can refinance loans, follow exactly what the website says but as I'm nervous I decide to ring their help desk to confirm that this application I was advised wouldn't be rejected therefore affecting my credit.  I was told if it was rejected I could contact them immediately and discuss why.  No surprise they rejected the loan and then when I rang back said they couldn't change the application to help me and I'd have to contact someone else to fix the problem.  So now credit rating has been hit and nothing has been resolved.  An absolute garbage bank "
Customer_1544, Shouldn't have spilt from TSB ," Gone downhill since spilling with TSB! I've been with BANK_NAME for 15years and since spilting with TSB their service has become shockingly bad. Blocked my card on the same transaction that I pay for a monthly bill (every month!), each month I have to call them just to unblock the transaction and get told that it could happen again next month & it does! I spend 20minutes each month answering security questions just to lift the block! I'm all up for security but it's ridiculous that a customer is telling you it's them paying the provider, provide all the details of the transaction & confirm that they will pay this amount monthly and yet you still continue to block the transaction!!!!! It's not even like I'm trying to make an international payment its only for a house hold bill!! terrible service... had enough of the poor service and decided to switch bank providers. "
Customer_1545, Don’t use BANK_NAME Bank SIMPLE !! ," Had a fraudulent transaction on a card. Called up warned them but they still paid it. (I’ve sadly have bowel, liver and lung cancer and told them I could do without the stress) Then the pain started. Have to wait for a stament to make a claim that it’s fraud. Then get a letter asking for an email asking explaining what happened. Emails bounce back. I call they are having trouble with emails at the moment! Cannot get put threw to fraud team to complain. Now I’ve got a letter saying we’ve not heard from you so we will be closing your case. (Other than the 15 phone calls!) Will be sending everything via recorded delivery! Best advise is to not use BANK_NAME they are dreadful. Even with the advert “if you have cancer we will help” it’s a joke. "
Customer_1546, Had an overdraft and paid it off after … ," Had an overdraft and paid it off after 1,5 years. After paying hundreds and thousands of pounds for fees and so on tried to apply again and everytime no matter what amount i was requesting they declined it giving me the standard answer that - personal circumstances, to ensure the commitment is affordable or our own financial risk. I paid everything on time, every loan or everything i had to pay but obviously not. If you were so scared why didnt you take the whole overdraft amount from my account when i had over 10k? Because they liked it to take their fees. Anyway, closing soon this account with them. Searching for a mee bank. Thanks "
Customer_1547, Overdraft ," Had an overdraft for more than a year with this bank, paid so many fees , hundred of pounds, everything was on time, and one day i had enough money and paid it off, after a few weeks tried to do an overdraft again, couldn’t get not even 50 pounds and when i called the number in the app they said i have to wait 6 months and maybe then i can get another overdraft. This is a joke, paid everything on time and it was nice to take so much money from me but when i needed help, good luck. "
Customer_1548, sick if the lies , had my card lost got a new card was told everything had been cancelled but still till this day I keep having money taken from my account.  sick of it all now changing banks and will never return to BANK_NAME again 
Customer_1549," Good, comprehensive and patient customer services ", Happy to report that this was a wonderful customer service experience. Friendly individuals with in-depth knowledge of services available to me. Helped me out with numerous things around trying to switch banks as a Non-UK EU resident in the UK. 
Customer_1550," After 18 years, the final straw "," Have banked with BANK_NAME for 18 years. Had my student account with them. Until recently I held my current, joint current, personal savings, joint savings, ISA, credit card, mortgage and children's savings accounts.Due to appalling service over the last year (and really since the split with TSB) I have closed the joint account, both savings, the ISA and the credit cards. I will be closing the children's savings soon, the mortgage when the term finishes (in 7 months) and finally my current account when all the rest is sorted.The online service is stuck in the 20th Century. It regularly fails and always at a weekend, conveniently not to inconvenience business customers. Their fraud department is over zealous on safe transactions but struggles to identify real fraud. I used to travel to Japan a lot, I had informed them of this, but every time I tried to book a plane ticket (no more than £800) the fraud department would flag it up.The call centre staff have been getting progressively ruder, snottier and incapable of helping. To be fair they're probably fed up of being on the receiving end of annoyed customers due to their company's inability to function.The branch staff are no better. The final straw was when I was attending a Japanese friend's wedding. I needed 5 ten pound notes to give as a gift and wanted to withdraw fresh notes as is the custom. The bank staff couldn't help, were completely unsympathetic and offered no attempt at a solution. I was told we can't do that"
Customer_1551, Dreadful ," Have had a terrible experience with BANK_NAME Bank trying to open a small business account and I would urge any start up business to look elsewhere for their banking. I set up the account on December 4th and they have still not sent out the paper work. I have gotten numerous calls trying to give me an unwanted loan or other services, but nothing on the account that I want to open. They're customer service line is terrible, I have been on hold on the phone for 25 minutes now and spent ages on hold yesterday before giving up as I was so busy. I will certainly be taking my business elsewhere and will recommend any other business do too. "
Customer_1552, Best Online Banking ," Have had lots of bank accounts with lots of different banks over the years and like BANK_NAME the best.  Usually open an account to get the switching incentive or the interest for a set period of time, then I am off to the next one.  Must admit I have never overdrawn in my life so have never been charged interest etc., so have never encountered any problems with charges but love their internet banking.  This is the best one out of all the banks I have banked with.  Don't often visit a branch but on the rare occasion when I have, I have found their staff to be helpful and friendly.  Will probably stick with BANK_NAME in the long run. "
Customer_1553, No problem ," Have had no problems with this. And rustpilot is full of fake reviews, they delete negative reviews on companies that pay for subscription to trustpilot. As with all smalltime organisations, power corrupts.Peace "
Customer_1554, Buyer Beware! Please don't use BANK_NAME bank for car insurance!! ," Having been enticed to BANK_NAME bank car insurance with a reasonable insurance quote for my Ford Mondeo ST200 V6, I decided to sell my vehicle and purchase a vehicle 2 years older, a Mitsubishi Shogun which was more suited for my lifestyle. I contacted BANK_NAME Bank to inform them of the change of vehicle to which I was told the underwriter could not insure this car and they would have to find another underwriter, after several minutes I was given my new quote! twice the price of my original policy....I was horrified, I googled other insurance companies and found that I could get the insurance at lots of other places for £200 cheaper! but and here is the final nail.... if you cancel for any reason from being car-less to dropping dead they charge you £55!Conning bast##ds! this is day light robbery, so I decided to cut my losses and cancel my policy and go to a better company and save £200.So my advice is, if this company BANK_NAME Bank offer you a competitive quote... don't take it! walk away fast, once they have you they will screw you!An unsupportive bad company!!DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!! "
Customer_1555, A member of staff reduced me to tears because she was in a hurry. , Hello I feel a bit weird writing about this but I would never do what was done to me so let's go. I lost my mum at Christmas I'm full of grief and to make it worse I had to pay some bills. I had some money to put in the bank and went to my local branch of BANK_NAME. I went in and they were shutting it was only 3.25 and I thought they closed at 4. The small woman who was closing the doors was there I'm on crutches as I have a bad back condition and said oh please its really important I only want to put this money in my account won't be a second. She said okay. I walked up to the window and the woman who was around 40 (I think so not a young girl)pulled a horrible face at me obviously put out by me handing her some money and putting my card in a machine. I said then to be nice oh this is really kind of you thanks. My mum died at Christmas and this is money I have to pay. She snorted and shrugged her shoulders I said did you hear what I just said my mum died. She said so what and shrugged again. So I asked again she said yes I did hear. So I like an idiot burst into tears. I felt so humiliated but her cruelty was so unexpected it set me off as I'm grieving and this wasn't even a month after losing her. She actually smiled and laughed and turned her back on me when I stood there crying.  I was so upset and the small woman who'd been locking the doors came back. I said she's not a very nice person is she and she pushed me out of the bank.  She said no you're wrong she's lovely and this is why I'm crying my eyes out making a complete div of myself. She laughed and said yes she is and I heard them laughing as the doors shut. I was so upset I actually thought of waiting to confront them when they came out but they sneaked out the back. I was going to let it go because there are lots of nice kind and loving people in the world too. But I can't because I went to go to the bank and even though I've stood up to bullies and all types of people and like to think I'm brave I couldn't go in without crying. I've lost most of my family over the last few years. I lost my dad as a young teen. I feel compassion for people and have helped people to the best of my ability. What type of person does that to another person who's in distress? They actually laughed at this I heard them. I've written to BANK_NAME. You know what I pity them because one thing I'm sure of is you always reap what you sow so when they're upset and distressed and someone is really cruel I hope they remember the absolute cold and horrible attitude they showed me. So basically their customer service is appalling in that branch. By the Oval Wirral.

Customer_1557, BANK_NAME- review , Hi ive been banking with BANK_NAME 13years plus I just started a new job and wanted my wages payed into it like i have done for years . the first couple of wages went in fine. i went to work friday 31st/07  (payday) so i gave my bank card to my partner to go do the shopping and what ever else we need only to be told that the machine took my card so after work i went into the bank to find out why only to be told my account had been closed and they cant tell me why so i would have to ring them from home to find out why i spent the next hour on the phone ( keep being pinged to the next department after department and then to be told they shut my account because i went -£5 over drawn . i have no overdraft on my account but it would always go a little over as long as it didnt go over a tenner i wouldnt be charged and it would be taken as soon as money was in there. so now we got no wages to live on as its been sent back to my employer which will take 3 days to clear i have no bank account and have had no letters warning me my account would be closed. And for the bank to tell me they done nothing wrong i find disgusting lucky i have a good supportive family 
Customer_1558, Jobsworth in  Ashton under lyne  Branch , Holly and Margaret  in Ashton under lyne Branch are jobsworth  and one has to  waste plenty of time before making them.realise how they have to do their job.

Customer_1559, HORRIFIC!!!!!!!!I ," HORRIFIC!!!!!!!!IIn November 2012,I was requested to attend a so-called Personal Finance Review"" -this turned out to be nothing more than a hard-nosed sales pitch by the staff involved  to get me to accept a loan {to pay off a credit card which was actually under control!} time and again I refused being told I must consider this loan and as a result of the constant verbal pressure"
Customer_1560, Disgusting ," I am currently moving house. I have exchanged contracts and will be moving in 2 weeks time. I am not working due to this and due to legal issues beyond my control the transaction has taken nearly 6 months. Thankfully my buyers were patient. Anyway, my funds have diminished so I asked BANK_NAME if I could extend my overdraft by a few £100 and they didn't want to know. I asked how I am supposed to eat and they suggested the food bank. Family have been able to help me out, thankfully. After completion, I expect to have > 0.5 million in my account. I will then open and account elsewhere and look forward to closing my BANK_NAME account, just to see how much they grovel.I have been with them for 30 years and have always run my account responsibly. They were ok when with TSB but since the breakup, things have deteriorated badly. I hear quite good things about TSB but BANK_NAME seem to have gone back to their 80's ways, when customer bullying was fair game (the big 4 had no competition back then, they do now. As others have said, I can only suspect that they are 'gracefully winding down the business'.).Last year the Brierley Hill branch refused to cash a check as the teller thought my signature didn't match that on file, even though I had other ID. I asked for a decision maker to review and they said no one there could do that. I then went to another branch and they were fine.Avoid at all costs people! There are far better banks out there. By your side? My a**e. "
Customer_1561, BANK_NAME Bank Customer Service is a TOTAL JOKE ," I am fed up complaining to BANK_NAME bank about issues and when I do they DO NOTHING other than make excuses. I complained about waiting 25 mins at my branch to be served and was promised a call back. NOTHING HAPPENED, When I told them £330 had gone missing they would do nothing for 7 days. I had to telephone the post office (where the money was paid in) as BANK_NAME bank REUSED TO. I have banked with them for 40 years. MORE FOOL ME! I am now going to find another bank who knows what customer service actually means. I spent 1.5 hours on the phone over this issue and got NOWHERE. "

Customer_1563, I am not even a BANK_NAME customer and … , I am not even a BANK_NAME customer and they have ticked me off big time!  A person known to me and warned to stay away from me by the police has started using my address on his account.  I tried reporting this 5 times to BANK_NAME.  The first time they told me I needed the postal code used to open the account.  I don't know that so they then told me they couldn't do anything unless I have the account number.  Eventually mail came with the account number but now they tell me I don't have the right to tell them to stop sending mail to my address.  The guy using my address is engaged in fraudulent activity and they won't even let me report it to them.  They told me to get a solicitor!!!  Why?  I haven't done anything wrong.  Is this to protect me from their fraudulent customer????  What a total joke! 
Customer_1564, Who is looking after my account....hello? ," I am supposed to have a Relationship Manager as a result of being a Premier Banking customer.I was advised that my account manager had resigned in May 2015 but heard nothing more from her replacement until I wrote in December 2015.Apologies followed but my point is to ask what the hell do these people do?There have been zero pro-active communications,no offers of how to invest my money,and no apparent interest in a customer of 43 years.....next please! "
Customer_1565, I applied for a current account ," I applied for a current account, and got offered the basic account. I accepted this, opened the account and got sent my debit card, pin number and online banking details. I tried to log in and after a few days...it was still saying that I had no products registered. It turns out that after telling me that I have an account, sending me a debit card etc...that my account has been unsuccessful. So why set up my account, only to tell me that I can't have it? Awful service. "
Customer_1566, They never sent my cards , I applied for the BANK_NAME Airmiles Duo Credit Card Account and have been told I was approved (through the rewards website) but I have received nothing from them. 
Customer_1567, No to a simple request , I asked them to stamp a document to say it was a copy of the original.  They apparently don't do this anymore.  I have been a customer for over 15 years and they used to do it.  I was not asking them to say they knew me just that one piece of paper was the same as another.  So now I have to pay a solicitor.  Why have a high street account when they don't provide a service?  No wonder BANK_NAME is losing out to internet banks. 
Customer_1568, Thanks for the complications ," I became overdrawn, my own fault. Two days before I could pay my account was deleted without warning. This made applying for my new job complicated. The contact service is a maze of questions and transfers leading to literally no progress after 15 minutes. "
Customer_1569, No help whatsoever , I booked a holiday and badabing what would you expect from Expedia they charged me twice. Anyway wouldn't my bank who is in control of my money step in and help its customer and just cancel the transaction? so that only one goes through? I have to wait 72 hours now in the hope that Expedia does it side of the deal and refunds me. So it is true any company can just fleece your bank account with Lloyd's BEWARE what a waste of time the customer service is as well. 
Customer_1570, I called up just to down grade my … , I called up just to down grade my account due to being unable to afford the monthly benefits fee. I was told I would be waiting around 20-30 minute “due to high call volume” (10:30am on a Tuesday morning) and I was waiting 1 hour 43 minutes and they terminated the call. You can understand my frustration. Worst bank I’ve ever used and they are getting a terrible reputation 
Customer_1571, Fraud ," i can't praise Lloyd Bank enough for preventing my account from being hacked.I received a text message asking if I made a transaction for 83p and of course I didn't so,I rand them and they detected it was a woman in America testing my card ready to make a larger withdrawal.BANK_NAME were very quick off the mark and cancelled my card and are getting another card to me within 5days.I can't praise BANK_NAME enough for spotting this so fast.Thank you BANK_NAME well done..one very happy customer.

Customer_1572, How to casually kill off an entire family ," I choose a BANK_NAME development loan to build our dream home after being advices by the branch manager that this would be a great way to do so.

Customer_1573, I don't have much to compare them with ," I don't have much to compare them with, but seriously taking 10 pounds for missing direct debit is a really horrible procedure. I don't have much money, I constantly try to survive from month to month, and that is just kicking someone who's already down. "
Customer_1574," Simply Shocking, life affecting. "," I dont know where to begin. I have recently relocated to Dubai and tried to make an international payment to my new landlord for rent, filed in his details and was told it would take 4/5 working days. fair enough, thats what I expected. After 5 working days I contacted BANK_NAME after questions from my current landlord about where the money was, after being on the phone for well over half and hour and transferred around different people I was told that the money should land in his account the following day. It didnt. On the 12th august(8 days after the payment was made) I contacted the bank again. Again I was on the phone for what seemed like an eternity and nobody wanted to talk to me. I eventually got through to the international transaction team who said that this 'Standard chartered bank' (middle bank) had haulted the payment until some security questions had been answered. I wasnt told this when I called so obviously wasnt happy with threats starting to come from my bank. I answered the questions and asked them to market the case as urgent. I explained my situation to the woman I spoke to and said how desperate I was that this needed to be resolved as I faced eviction and possible jail time as not paying rent is a legitimate reason for being jailed in Dubai. Did she care? of course not, nobody at BANK_NAME did. Because after it was marked urgent the payment wasnt followed up for another TEN DAYS. and was only evenuitally followed up after I filed an official complaint. In those 10 days I spent what seemed like a fortune on phone calls, had been evicted from my flat for not paying rent for two days without access to any of my belongings, including clean clothes as well as the landlord threatening to call the police on a daily basis. Most people would understand how urgent this was and how stressful this would make somebody after relocating to a new country but apart from BANK_NAME 'marking a note as urgent' they did nothing to chase my payment. Now I have managed to borrow money from a family member a few days ago to finally get access back to my flat and relieve the threat of jail time, but now owe a family member a significant amount of money. BANK_NAME still havent been able to chase my payment to put it back in my account and have said on numerous occations that they have tried and failed to contact standard chartered bank. FAILED TO GET A RESPONSE. I couldnt believe it, the bank BANK_NAME trust to transfer my money, they cant contact and I was even told from the manager of customer services that she doesnt think they have done anything wrong. I tried to explain that I was a BANK_NAME customer, not a standard chartered customer and it is BANK_NAME responsibility to make sure the money arrives at the required destination. I am happy to pay the transaction fees if this happens. I was denied the opportunity to speak to any senior member of staff to take this matter further which has just been typical of the service I have recieved. Since my latest conversation I have had no choice but to contact the financial services authority as each day which passes is costing my family money and nobody at BANK_NAME could care one bit. I refuse to accept that what is being done is adequate as this has gone on for 3 weeks now. Richard Wilson "
Customer_1575, I find that the BANK_NAME Business most … ," I find that the BANK_NAME Business most managers are unethical and unhelpful.I started my business in October 2011 so I had 12 0r 18 months free banking after that they started to charge me the service charges every month average of £40 a month. Time to time they were sending me a letter saying to change my tariff to reduce my cost. I am not a very smart person and did not know how to do it either? So I had asked the business manager to change the tariff to the suitable one in more than 3 occasions. I even told them every time that I am too thick and don't understand also do not know how to change my tariff but they did not help.A few months ago they have charged me almost double the amount of my normal monthly charges.So, I rang and spoke to the business manager and he told me that was an error so he wiped the whole charges for that month and put me on a new tariff which is now costing me about £15 a month average which is a £25 a month average saving which is very good for a small business.I had recently raised a complaint about my previous high charges had taken by the bank and they have declined to pay the over charges. I am going to take this matter to the Financial Ombudsman also hope and pray that FCA should look into the high over charges taking by the multinationals Bank just like the PPI. So please if your tariff is not right then get some help and that will save you lot of your hard earn cash. "
Customer_1576, Bureaucratic and unhelpful ," I found the service quite ridiculous to be honest.I was referred by a friend and applied online for the Avios rewards credit cards. In spite of a spotless credit history and other card applications going through swiftly with other banks, I was told that I had to pop in to a local branch to show my ID. Sure, fine. The email stated that I could come in with my EU issued driving licence. At my local branch (Cabot sq., Canary Wharf) my EU licence was declined because it's not a photocard"". Unfortunately my government will not change the format of their driving licences just to please BANK_NAME Bank. I was told to come back with my passport. Needless to say I will do no such thing"
Customer_1577, Good Products (Credit Card) - Atrocious customer service ," I got a LLyods Avois credit card last year, mainly because of the avois points and the 0% foreign transaction fee. The credit card is a great product if those are the things you are looking for. The customer service at BANK_NAME is atrocious. The bank agents are poorly trained and unaware of their own bank policies. I have, on several occasions, been hung up on (this has happened to bank agents as well when I have been in the branch). As long as you never have to deal with customer service, BANK_NAME is great. But it seems higher management is totally disconnected or blissfully unaware of how incompetent bank staff are. "
Customer_1578, My Worst Experience with Lloyd Bank Staffs , I got terrible experience with Lloyd Bank.  It's been 1 month and I didn't got an account yet. Some of staffs are very rude to customers. I got an appointment on Wolverhampton BANK_NAME bank on 16 oct at 1and waited long time and some staff from BANK_NAME bank said they interview the wrong person not me . and also said Come again next week and make an appointment again. Now I am going to make a bank account on another bank. Worst Experience ever 
Customer_1579, Life changers! ," I had a really bad credit due to a debt that i had being a victim of fraud, which in theory affected my credit rating badly, When every other bank turned me down, including BANK_NAME! Whom i was banking with for several years! Never allowed me to build my credit rating by an overdraft etc, i joined BANK_NAME a couple year ago, quite frankly it is by far the best thing ive done, the bank manager listened to me, understood me, then helped me open a basic account with a very small overdraft to increase my credit rating, 2 years later that over draft turned into hundreds and ive bought my first house, my credit rating is superb! And personally id like to thank BANK_NAME for that opportunity because this bank genuinly made a difference in my life! "
Customer_1580, worst bank for business account , I had a very bad experience with BANK_NAME bank. I tried to open a small business bank account and i wouldn't recommend anyone to open a business account in BANK_NAME. I set my bank account on November 2014 and they said my bank will be open within a week. After a week i received my card and check book etc. I thought my business account is open so i went to the bank to put some money in the business account. Then the guy said my account is blocked i asked him what was the problem he said he didn't know. He said give me ur number i ll contact you tell you what's the issue with that account. I gave him my number came back. 1 week went bt nobody rang me so i went to the bank again and found out the guy who made my account he moved somewhere else.so i told other business staff what happened he said they need some more details so i provided all the details then they said they will ring me and let me know if my bank account open or not. Then nobody rang me so after 1 week i went to the bank again then they said give it another week and come back hopefully it will be open by then. 19 January Monday i went to the bank again i told them i provided all the details they need bt its been 2 weeks i didn't get any confirmation yet. Then they asked me for my  number again they said they will speak to the guy who made my account and let me know whats going on and guess what nobody rang me so im really disappointed and planning to go another bank. I wouldn't recommend  anyone to go to this bank.  Its been probably 3 months  or more and my business account is still blocked. This bank is nightmare for business accounts. I will never go to that bank again...... 
Customer_1581, Playing with people ," I had an appointment in the Westfield shopping centre to open a bank account. The operator on the phone told me what documents to bring. I brought them and one of the staff members told me, that they arent good enough, and told me what i had should've brought. I set up an appointment for another day, came with the right documents and it was the same thing again. The documents werent good, even if the staff member told me what documents specifectly to bring. Thank God, I have an appointment at BANK_NAME bank. If BANK_NAME bank plays with people like this, I have no idea how can it not loose all the clients "
Customer_1582, BANK_NAME Bank ," I had the most pleasant banking experience opening a bank account in BANK_NAME, Bradford. I would highly recommend dealing with this branch. Having moved over from Ireland, I have found it almost impossible to open an account having difficulty providing proof of address given I do not have a bank account in the country. The manager of this branch Andrew was so helpful. He personally set up my meeting for me and did so to work around my job. I had my appointment the following week, first thing in the morning and it was Andrew himself that opened the doors of the bank at 9am sharp and was there to greet me. "
Customer_1583, Very good customer service with online problem but underlying incompatibilities a cause for concern ," I has set up and paid an International payment to a new recipient but one week later discovered that it had not been paid.  When I set up the recipient I had a problem with confirming on my mobile but it went through on my land line and I made the payment; so it was a complete surprise that the money had not left my account.  When I phoned in I was served immediately and very politely.   I went through the whole transaction again with the line open to the support team.  It failed again with Chrome and then with Firefox.  In each instance there was apparently no record at the BANK_NAME end that the transaction had been logged.I was then asked to use IE and not only did it work and surprisingly the details I had previously input were already there.  I was told that their system has not been checked out on Browsers other than IE with Windows.  When this transaction was completed I was not asked to confim by mobile or landline so I assume some input had taken place by the LLoyd's team.I remain concerned that despite completing a recipient set up and a payment nothing was paid out and the transaction disappeared.  Also that when the mobile confirmation was in progress I was logged out and a message asked me to call a number which the Lloyd's support chap ....did not recognise"".  All rather disconcerting. """
Customer_1584, I have a business account with BANK_NAME … , I have a business account with BANK_NAME and i have had a few hiccups but yesterday a lovely gentleman called Rob went above and beyond his duty to help with a situation i had no control over and saved the day Thank you Rob 
Customer_1585, Online Banking that tips you into insanity ," I have a business account with BANK_NAME bank, and only use it rarely to run a  very small Property Management Company.  I have never experienced such frustration, I gave up with their card access because that was a nightmare, and the batteries run out frequently.  Now I log in with 'Memorable Information'.  Maybe every 6 months I try to log in, to pay bills etc,  by then, I cannot remember what  'Memorable information I have saved, and you cannot even get a hint. ( like most web sites ) a prompt like first school, first pet, boyfriend etc.  Well I dont know about anyone else, but I have lived and long and fruitful life, and glad to say I have LOTS of memories.  So how do they expect me to remember just one. OK I should have written it down (somewhere)! I know BANK_NAME are trying to make it harder for the scammers, and security breaches.  But, PLEASE can you make it easier for Customers? "
Customer_1586, Friendly Helpfull Staff , I have a current account with them & I cant fault the customer service staff at the bank at all. I'd give them 5 stars if it werent for the fact that they pay the top dogs at BANK_NAME oversized bonuses & pay pathetic interest on there accounts to customers with good credit! 
Customer_1587, Extremely unhelpful business banking ," I have a start up limited company and need a business banking account. having been a personal customer of BANK_NAME for more than 20 years it seemed obvious to take my business banking needs to them. They declined my application. The reason is hidden behind you do not meet our criteria"" and they dont disclose their criteria. My business is cash funded "
Customer_1588, Zero complaints. Friendly service , I have always had great service when I go into the branch. I do find it is always easiest to go into the branch if you need help with anything. The staff are always helpful and friendly. 
Customer_1589, 25 years' custom and they let me down big time ," I have banked with BANK_NAME for 25 years.  Earlier this year I paid money in via the out of hours deposit.  They lost the deposit and had the cheek to tell me that it takes 48 hours to credit cash paid in - this was an excuse they made up whilst they tried to find my money.  I hoped this would be an isolated event, however the next time I paid money they keyed in the wrong amount.  It transpired that I was credited with someone else's cash, and they were credited mine.Fast forward to today and I asked them to certify one of my bank statements to be used as ID as I am buying a property.  My solicitor needed them to certify my bank statement as I am a new client of the solicitor.  The bank refused to do so!  They told me that they only certify bank statements internally if you are buying one of their products or something from Scottish Widows!!!  I pointed out that I wouldn't need the statement certified by them if I was buying something internal.So folks, the moral of the story is, BANK_NAME bank will not be there when you need them.  25 years' custom down the drain.  Once the mortgage is sorted I will be leaving this bank and give my money to BANK_NAME who actually do care about customers. "
Customer_1590, Been customer for 10 years , I have been a BANK_NAME bank customer for 10 years and I have always used telephone banking to transfer money. I rang up this morning to simply transfer money into my sisters account to be told I can no longer do this for security. I challenged this with the advisor and then spoke with the manager to be told the same. Noyone could help me. Also BANK_NAME are refusing to refund me for my PPI claim. Avoid at all costs. Im In the process of changing banks right now....... !

Customer_1592, I have been left embarrassed by BANK_NAME … ," I have been left embarrassed by BANK_NAME very recently. I gave as a wedding gift to my daughte, a cheque for £1000, l made sure that funds were available and handed her the cheque at a celebration meal. On Saturday morning my daughter txt to say that the cheque bounced, l immediately telephoned BANK_NAME, where Liam told me that the problem was with the recipients bank, l believed him.Within ten minutes the post arrived, a letter from BANK_NAME saying alteration requires Drawers signature"". I telephoned BANK_NAME again"
Customer_1593, Pathetic customer service , I have been trying for a month now to get a response from them about a problem I have.  I have written three letters and sent five emails and have not had a single response to any of them other than the standard email promising a contact within five days which hasn't happened!  I don't think I have ever experienced such poor customer service as this - I will be changing banks asap as they clearly don't care at all!  Avoid at all costs! 
Customer_1594, Appalling Customer Service - Trying for months to close my account ," I have been trying for months to close my business bank account that I have had since 2004.  BANK_NAME have all the paperwork they need from me - copies of passports, security questions, letters from my bank in Australia (Westpac).  I have spent hours on the phone trying to figure out what the problem is - have made formal complaints -and it has NEVER been resolved.   They claim they will get in touch but have never done so by either phone or email.  And although they said they would stop the monthly fees - they haven't.   For some reason they don't close the account but, still continue to take out monthly charges - 4 days ago spoke with Natalia Baker and Paul Tait - who promised it would be resolved.  But still NOTHING!   What the heck is going on? !   Do I need to take you to court?????? "
Customer_1595, Good support when your in boom but will kick you when your down. , I have been with BANK_NAME business banking for over 10 years. Not sure if any other bank will be any better so have not moved. I have a very miserly overdraft limit for unexpected payments (£3500) --which is really not much when you may have a temporary cash flow problem. Due to not owning any property BANK_NAME have always refused to increase this limit. Very strange when others are willing to lend tens of thousands as loans without any security. So hence the title of my review -- Very helpful as long as my cash flow is positive but will be ready to be ruthless when the sun is not shining. 
Customer_1596, I have been with BANK_NAME for over 10… , I have been with BANK_NAME for over 10 years with both personal and business. An error was made on my companies house info regarding my nationality - my accountant stated I was British when in fact I am Irish. The error was corrected immediately but BANK_NAME have proceeded to close my business accounts down due to the small error and not allowed me to continue my banking with them. Zero loyalty to existing customers and they have lost their appeal to me now! I have moved to Santander and they are much better. 
Customer_1597, I have been with Lloyd's since 1992 ," I have been with Lloyd's since 1992.  When you are flush they are all over you, as soon as you are struggling they immediately pull your overdraft amount, it's instant!  So much for being there for you! It doesn't matter you have banked with them for over 30 years and never negated on a loan or let them down...means nothing. Their ratings speak for themselves. If you are opening a new account why would you choose them? "
Customer_1598, Really good bank ," I have been with them ever since I moved to the UK and I am really happy with them. Easier than any-other bank to register especially when you just move here and you don't really have a good English - my account was open in half an hour with a really nice adviser. Never had any issue with them, always friendly staff.. I recommend all of my friends that move in the UK to go there. "
Customer_1599, EXPECT OVER ONE HOUR ON HOLD TO SPEAK TO CUSTOMER SERVICE ," I have experienced some bad customer service, but BANK_NAME took it to I have experienced some bad customer service, but BANK_NAME took it to another level. I never thought possible. These guys were truly spectacularly bad, with zero contrition or a sense of urgency to assuage customer concerns and pleas to improve their service. I have been trying to get car insurance and BANK_NAME bank keep blocking my credit card, preventing me from completing my purchase of the car insurance. What’s more, I have been to the local BANK_NAME bank, on recommendation of their telephone call centre agent, with my passport, ID and all the requisite information; obtained their assurances that the block on my card had been lifted, only to discover that the claim simply was not true. I resolved to call the call centre again, over the course of THREE days, with each call lasting over ONE HOUR ON HOLD to be passed on to a customer service agent. The last call on the third day even lasted 0NE AND a HALF HOURS!! The frustration was made even worse by one the call centre members asking me to tone down my anger, since she was not there to be abused, despite my not resorting to invectives or any foul language at any point. One other agent even had the audacity to say the long waiting times had nothing to do with her (it wasn’t her problem). I did raise my voice in frustration, and did apologise for this. How can the bank explain such a hideous service and utter contempt for their customers? AVOID THIS POMPOUS UTTERLY CONTEMPTUOUS INSTITUTION IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU. Their true colours are revealed when you need them to dutifully expedite  a transaction for you. "
Customer_1600, Choose another bank - it will surely not be as bad as BANK_NAME ," I have had a current account with BANK_NAME for 35 years. To set this up in 1980 took 5 minutes and I have been a loyal and model customer ever since. When I set up my own business earlier this year I was told my track record means setting up a business account would be much more straightforward. This could not be further from the truth. After 3 months my account is still not open.  My complaints are as follows:1. When you call you have to give the same information to the machine several times . When you finally get to a person they ask for the same information again. This all takes around half an hour.2. They clearly have no clue what people do when running their own business. I was asked what I would be doing and whether I would be on holiday when I was not doing paid work. Why did they need to ask this question anyway?3. The 'compliance department' asks meaningless questions including about future income, not seeming to recognise that there is uncertainty about the future. Are they going to hold me to it? or refuse my money if it does not fit what I told them? 4. They ask the same questions several times. You give them the answer and they come back a week later with the same questions. The more answers you give, the more questions they ask.5. They asked for proof of future income. When I produced some evidence from my prospective client the people at my local branch did not know how to put it 'on the system'. This caused another week's delay.6. There is no evidence of progress and no information about progress. I had to phone to check. There is no one person to speak to, only a different member of the team"" (I use that term ironically)7. It is now 2 months since I started doing work for my business. I have had to use my personal current account to pay for expenses and cannot invoice my clients yet because I do not have a bank account.  Heaven knows when my clients will finally pay me.8. They have phoned me up several times offering other services I don't want such as insurance"
Customer_1601, Outstanding helpful customer service ," I have had continual outstanding customer service for my Business Account with BANK_NAME... especially from Paul Williams today, nothing was too much trouble and a lovely Brummy Accent too.  Thanks BANK_NAME... so glad I chose you from your many competitors "
Customer_1602, Business banking manager not up to much , I have had personal accounts with BANK_NAME for more than 20 years.  No problems there.  But I want to move my business accounts from Santander and started the process to 'switch banks
Customer_1603, Fraud fraud fraud- BANK_NAME at its worst! ," I have had some negative experiences with my card being clones a few ones with BANK_NAME. This happened about 4 times. I was resilient and kept on, accepting their apologies, refunds and assurances. I have come to the end of my tether however. In the last 2 weeks I've had to spend a total of 6 hours on the phone (?) trying to sort out a recent fraudulent transaction on my account. When it happened I called BANK_NAME and had to wait for two hours  for the fraud team. I had to go to bed so I hung up and so woke up at 5.30am the next morning to try again.  I froze everything, cancelled my cards and tried to get on life while I waited for a new card. Fast forward a week and still no card so I called to ask and explain the situation. This time I told them about how I had been told that the fraud happened over the phone, BANK_NAME told me that this was not possible even though I had just been told that a few days earlier. Anyway, I re-ordered another card which also didn't come. I asked if I could send it to a branch and was told absolutely no way. (This conversation was another hour btw) After securing my internet etc I unfroze my online account only to find MORE FRAUDULENT activity!!!! I called again and was on the phone for a further 2 hours today before it was dealt with. At the end of the call they said go into the branch and order a new card (even though they told me I couldn't do this) and that if it happens again then it will be negligence on my part!!! Bear in mind that I have had a few card cloning situations that BANK_NAME didn't protect me from before! After all this I am going to leave BANK_NAME as soon as humanly possible! "
Customer_1604, Totally unacceptable ," I have just tried to deposit cash in Golders Green branch. The line stretches through the whole area of the  branch , the deposit machine broken. One cashier onlyGave up after 15 min and drove to the Hampstead branch which turned out to be closed . This is how BANK_NAME Bank treats their faithful customers ( over 30 years with them)Totally furious! "
Customer_1605, Do NOT care about the MOMENTS in your life... , I have never felt compelled to write about my experiences with a bank until now!  My opinion of banks are that they are all the same ie THEY ALL WANT YOUR MONEY.  I am loyal to a bank based on the way I have been treated as a human being - we all have ups and we all have downs.  I have realised that BANK_NAME (and their *ankers} are only interested in the 'ups' and thus treat you with total disregard when you have a a 'moment' of financial uncertainty in life.  As soon as I have paid off the credit I owe them I will never go near any of their products again!  Also just noticed that they have 2 choices for BANK_NAME Bank - 1 hyphenated and the other isn't which take you to two different reviews and thus divide the opinions in half! Sort your Customer Service out BANK_NAME! 
Customer_1606, I can't get to speak to a complaints manager. , I have now been waiting for two hours to speak to a complaints manager.their complaints procedure is non existent. They have tied my phone line up which I use for my business and it has probably cost me over £200 in lost trade. For that I have been offered £1.60 for the cost of my phone calls . I shall be looking to change to another bank asap.This is not the first or even the second time this has happened but it will certainly be the last. 
Customer_1607," A bunch of amateurs, clumsy and unprofessional "," I have recently tried to get my new card delivered to a new UK address and change phone numbers while living outside the UK, and this has been a dreadful tour through hell. I have had to spend hours on the phone because they didn't do what they had said they would do and could not remember what they had done. They sent me a letter confirming the change of address, but the card never arrived, and when I called them they were holding on to my card because they didn't have my new address! Is this a bank or some kinder garden? This delayed my project for a weak, and they issued paltry 25 pounds as apology. How generous! Also in changing phone numbers they put the UK code +44 in front of my Korean country code even though I told them this is a Korean number!! What a pitiful bunch of idiots! "
Customer_1608, Disappointing ," I have to say that the online banking and their banking application is excellent, buy it stops there. They might as well shut the small banks, Bristol Road Gloucester is not uncommon to see one cashier, yet the building is huge, the other rooms which I'm guessing for customers to discuss their issues are rarely used. I've never seen them in use. It's little wonder they charge the public as much as they do. They treat customers like rubbish, yet the adverts on TV give this immediate prompt service. "
Customer_1609, Self Service , I have tried several times to order a cheque book on line through self service as instructed by BANK_NAME but everytime I am informed that the service is not available. I can't even email the bank !!!!Thank god I have an alternative to this bank as I also use Santander  :) 
Customer_1610, Beware: BANK_NAME bank will find any excuse to rip you off ," I joined BANK_NAME club card and one of the conditions was to to transfer my previous bank account to them.I had to direct debits transferred to this account (as it was one of their requirements)As I did not transfer £1500 each month into the account they charged me £5 per month as fee"" which were deducted each month of the interest I was receiving.The two direct debits were for credits cards.Over the last two months I did not use one of the credit cards and the bank found it as an excuse to deprive me of the interest due to me over those two months.Just to add insult to injury they still charged me £5 fee for each of these monthsI immediately closed my account with them and advised my friends and family to do the same """
Customer_1611, Bunch of lobotomised chimps... ," I left the UK indefinitely in September 2016. I made arrangements for the contents of my Lloyd's savings account to be transferred to my overseas bank account and for it to be closed. The bank manager assured me everything was in order. It did not happen. Fine, while abroad, I would just mail in the forms to change my home address to my new one so that my bank mail would stop going to my ex-partner. This had no effect. So now I've been on hold with an international call for ages trying to sort it out.Thank you BANK_NAME, you incompetent tw@ts who cannot perform the simplest of tasks. A bunch of lobotomised chimps would be as effective as you. "
Customer_1612, 10/10 recommend it 100 percent , I love them like my personal accountants so good call me anytime they have something I can upgrade to got the platinum account also knew I had my nail apointment booked it so was super quick explaining everything 
Customer_1613, The worst bank I have opened an account at ," I made an application to open an account 3 weeks ago, I brought  the needed documents to the branch, and then after 2 weeks I received a message telling me that I need to take my documents to the branch (AGAIN!! ) and that I should check my email about that. On the email there was nothing, I went to the branch, they apologized that someone hasn't done his job properly and I opened again the account. Now I have received the same message telling me I need to bring the documents (I HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT!! )I called them around 5 times so far, and they couldn't give me a reason and I went to the branch 2 times just to open an account. The next time I will go to the branch, I will do it to withdraw my application.I don't recommend this bank not even to my enemy. "
Customer_1614, I must admit ," I must admit, banks have a bad name, I have been struggling with high interest debt for a little while, having been a BANK_NAME customer for some 20 years, they listened, took my situation into its individual circumstance, and they have consolidated everything and saved me a fortune. Very rare review, but a fact "
Customer_1615, Just not vey good ! ," I noticed money taken out of my account which i did not recognize so got in contact with BANK_NAME. I was constantly put on hold whilst they asked this dept & that dept and as i was at work i could not hold any longer than the 30 mins i had already wasted. The young lady said she had logged everything and when i rang again we could take it from there.When i rang again nothing had been logged so i have had to go through the whole process once again.The simple fact is someone has taken money out of my account on BANK_NAME banks watch and they want me to hang around on the phone while they transfer me to every Dept imaginable.Poor, poor service.

Customer_1616, Multiple failures - account blocked for days - Worst bank for business banking ," I opened a business account with them and I would like to warn as many people as I can that this is the worst bank to do business with. They will put a block on your account for days or even weeks because they forgot to do all the necessary checks when you opened the account in the first place. They will not let you know what is happening, they will not answer your calls, their employees are rude and indifferent. Your whole company will be on a standstill for days waiting for some information for what is happening. Day 7 now, I still don't know what information I need to give them for them to unblock my business account. This was the worst banking experience I ever had in my whole life. "
Customer_1617, Bring Back TSB ," I opened an account 35 years ago at my local bank which was then TSB. I thought they were bad. It then became BANK_NAME and now BANK_NAME. This bank has gone downhill fast in the 2 years it has had its new owners. Never more than one cashier on although there are usually 4 or 5 people behind the counter. I have seen queues almost outside but never open a second cashier. There used to be 3 but they have recently put in a self service for deposits which no-one ever uses. I was asked if I wanted to be shown how to use but as I pay a rather large sum for my business account  I am not going to do it myself when I pay them to do it. I have just tried to transfer money to my ISA account from my current account and been given the message that it cant be done online and been given a number to call. Haha, so much for easy transfer between account"""
Customer_1618, Froze my business account and didn't tell me ," I opened an account at the end if June 2016. The first payment from our client went in on 6th July; after which BANK_NAME froze our account claiming they needed 'Proof of Entitlement' for the funds. It's is now 22nd July and have been advised can take up to 8 weeks to resolve even though I have sent through 17 pages of supporting documentation. I have been told that my complain will be escalated and I will be receiving a letter that the process is ongoing, basically they implied that there was nothing they could do about it and they didn't really want to anyway.Absolute clowns!I had to open an account at Santander in order to continue running my business and had to pay suppliers out if my personal account this month.To be fair if like me you think banking with TSB will be ok and they will take care of me you have been warned. They are the two Bob bank.Horrendous customer service. Wish I'd read these reviews before opening an account with them. "
Customer_1619, Snake oil salesmen/women and non-English speaking customer service make this THE worst company I've ever dealt with ," I opened my first account with BANK_NAME as a naive teenager. I simply wanted a current account in which to pay my wages. Little did I know that the underhanded member of staff had signed me up for a select account that would cost me over £10 per month. Having realised this, I returned to the bank and asked him to change it. Sorry"
Customer_1620, Fraudalent bank with capital controls in place , I really do not think a business customer with a significant deposits at this bank deserves to be treated like this.I have a debit visa cards and already on two occasions it has been declined for some medium size transactions. This was embarrassing at least.But even worse is how you are being treated as customer. They give you a number to call but forget you will get through. A series of automated queries and already 1 hour on hold because they are 'extremely' busy.How to call this other than FRAUD? 
Customer_1621, What customer service?! ," I received a letter about checking my account online. Upon attempting to sign into my account, I was kicked out on multiple occasions. I was given a 0345 number to contact, answered automated security questions and wasn't put through to an advisor! No one attended my call. Very poor from this bank considering I've been a customer for 25 years, as is my family. "
Customer_1622, Credit where credit's due. ," I recently had reason to contact BANK_NAME customer service about an in branch experience. I optimistically tried to resolve an issue in my lunch hour and the branch was crazy busy. I complained about the disappointing experience on their website because if you don't tell a company there's something wrong they can't do something about it.Imagine my amazement when, a week later I received a letter upholding my complaint and apologising for the in branch experience. And what's more they had decided to make it up to me by putting £30.00 in my current account, one pound for every minute I had waited! This got me thinking and I remembered another time they impressed me. I had a loan with them and was supposed to get a statement every month, I didn't get one for 3 months so I rang them about it. Imagine my surprise when they sent me a cheque for £150.00 refunding 3 months loan repayments.I don't think they deserve 2 out 5 review as a company, remember, people are much more likely to complain about something than give credit for exceeding expectations. "
Customer_1623, Amazing Customer Service , I see a load of complaints so could just be that I spoke to someone that actually wanted to help me. Basically money had been taken out of my account leaving me overdrawn then being charged £10 a day for the unplanned overdraft fees. Contacted customer service straight away once I noticed this and once explaining what had happened I got put straight through to the fraud department and after being on the phone for no more than 30 minutes we managed to go through all the unknown transactions report it as fraud and got a full refund on everything even money that disappeared over a month ago that I never noticed and really polite helped me a lot got my refund within 10 minutes so thumbs up from me :) Happy customer 
Customer_1624, Perhaps BANK_NAME thinks customers who have to wait 1h+ on the phone will forget their complaint ," I spent 1h 45 minutes on the phone as I was unable to complete the monthly transfer for £200 to my own Help to Buy ISA. Despite the money being on the account. And to add insult to injury, at one point I was transferred to another department with the promise that there would be no wait for this change - I waited an additional 28 minutes. I'll be changing my bank account. What a waste of a Sunday morning. "
Customer_1625, TERRIBLE SERVICE! Won't even accept a valid UK cheque! ," I spent over 20 minutes trying to pay a cheque to clear my BANK_NAME Bank credit card, but was told by the VERY RUDE cashier at their WELLING LONDON branch that they won't accept it. No reason given and there was no manager present who I could complain to. One of the ways BANK_NAME claims you could pay their bill is by visiting a branch and I had no previous problems, as I usually post my cheque in. At the branch, I called BANK_NAME so-called customer service"" line and they said they would call the branch and then told me they couldn't help me because no one was answering - despite at least 3 staff present in the branch! I had to travel to another BANK_NAME branch where my cheque was accepted. Worst customer service ever! Time to cut the strings - and the card. """
Customer_1626, Worst Business Bank & Customer Service ," I switched to Lloyd and had no issues with them until few days ago.I went to Croatia on holidays and when I returned I found my Business account is locked. I understand that Lloyd might have needed some additional information so I went to Lloyd branch with lot of documents to unlock my business account. Their customer service was pathetic, branch manager forwarded me to the Retail business banking on the phone and they kept me on hold for more than 2 hours. Even then the issue wasn't cleared and they told me to provide the information by post ONLY. This is pathetic as I told them the urgency of unblocking the account but they don't really care. Salaries were not paid from my business account, also all the incoming payments and standing orders were blocked by BANK_NAME. I feel my money is not safe with Lloyd so I am taking them to Financial Ombudsman as their complaint department doesn't even listen and resolve the issue. "
Customer_1627, I think the description of 1 star sums … ," I think the description of 1 star sums it up.  Bad experience, unreasonable and rude.I'm a business customer and I've never known business support"" to be further from the truth.  BANK_NAME were obstructive and overbearing and clearly did not understand my industry or my business.  If you're looking for a business bank account"
Customer_1628, I took a small loan (£2000) ," I took a small loan (£2000), their website (as well as their app) says that APR is on ~5% which is a bulls.it!The APR is 30%!!!That’s not over!Interest charge is £30-£40 a month!!!Just thiefes, what else I can say?Next time you’ll pay a loan by yourself, I guarantee You ;) "
Customer_1629, Online banking is a joke ," I tried to make my first payment online. You have to set up a recipient"" and to do so phone ( would you believe it ??) some BANK_NAME person (how inefficient and dangerous compared to using Pins is that??) to go through a ""telephone authorisation procedure"". Presumably during banking hours and then it may take 2 banking days. So in the end I paid my rent from my foreign account. That's nothing to do with Online banking"
Customer_1630, Careless handling of personal documents ," I tried to open a business account. My wife was asked to bring her passport and proof of address to a physical branch. We went to the branch close to Bond Street station in London, where a member of staff made copies of her passport, her residence permit, and our proof of address. That happened 12 days ago, but the account is still not open because the copies of these documents have not arrived at the appropriate centre. BANK_NAME did not inform me of this until I made several calls to inquire. No-one seems to know where the copies of my wife's personal documents have gone to.This failure to open an account has caused me considerable hassle and expense, but I would particularly advise people to be wary of BANK_NAME because of the bank's inability to treat personal documents appropriately (and for the poor response/awareness of staff when it comes to addressing these issues). "
Customer_1631, BANK_NAME Business Banking  - My advice is to go elsewhere ," I tried to open a BANK_NAME Treasurer's"" account in early 2015. Even after applying considerable prerssure"
Customer_1632, Terrible branch cottingham hull , I use to feel sorry for local branches. But the branch in cottingham east riding. Really needs a shake up of the poor customer service. What the cannot be bothered you have all day to wait attitude members of their staff adopt. Really would not miss that branch if it were to close. Just waited in a queue of 4 people whilst the one slow could not care less member of staff a rather effeminate small man with a bitchy attitude. Waited 20 mins whilst he is still serving the same woman asking about isa s and transferring her money into different accounts. After 20 mins I needed to get back to work. Asked do you have another member of staff you can open other window. To be told no we only gave 3 staff on and other two are busy in the back. You can come back later if you cannot wait. This was said in a very ofhand and I will take all day attitude.I sopose these  staff go unchallenged. So if this branch closes will I feel sorry for that rude little man to lose his job?? No will be quite pleased. And I will not be coming back later. Will look for a bank where the branch staff care about customers and how long they keep them waiting.... 
Customer_1633, BANK_NAME will never protect you against fraud , I was a victim of fraud for 129.70 with my BANK_NAME bank account as somebody used my debit card informations to buy a playstation with paypal. As soon as i realised that i called BANK_NAME bank fraud team and reported the fraud and the refunded my money. After 2 months BANK_NAME card debited my account with the same amount and i had to call them back and report the fraud.A lady representative said to me that the bank does not recognise any fraud. There were 2 more transactions that i didn't recognise and reported them to her and she said that it's ok since the money were in and out!!! Hiw ridiculous????? I said to her i don't recognise the transactions and she did nothing.She was refusing to refund me the money and asked to speak with her manager.He was refusing as well and both of them were so unprofessional and rude and were trying to make me feel guilty for something i didn't do.No protection at all from the bank for 129.79 pounds!!!! What a disgrace for a bank that says we would always protect you against fraud!!!They should change it into we will never protect you against fraud!!!Soon to close my account with them. 
Customer_1634, Please open more cashier desks. ," I was amazed to see the fabulous in-house advertising in Lloyd's bank, king Street, south Shields.They must have spent thousands of pounds on these digital displays. All telling the line of impatient customers how good"" the new banking policy is... How they have more personal advisers.But"
Customer_1635, Unprofessionalism and crookery ," I was in a restaurant near one of the central London branches when an employee sat with his friends at the table next to mine. After a short chit chat he started discussing work and my name poped up. It is a very rare name indeed, and once he stated the account size to uninvolved individuals it was clear that they are talking about me. The manner of talk was disrespectful and offensive. "
Customer_1636, Lying usless Bank ," I was lied to when I took my credit card out by the staff in the bank, dealing with so many departments on other issues and a truly awful call center in the Philippines not there to help, UK is greatLeft without money because of a CPA over xmas "
Customer_1637, opening account ," I was looking to open business account with them but reading comments here got me thinking ,cant afford to get my account or debit card frozen so  I 'll go with metro bank for now "
Customer_1638, I was mugged last year for a hefty sum … ," I was mugged last year for a hefty sum of money in November. The fraud team helped me within five minutes,  quickly, friendly and helpful.  Can't thank them beautiful people enough "
Customer_1639, Summertown BANK_NAME well done! ," I was very disappointed by a rude staff last Friday at Kidlington branch however, the Summertown branch I went today was a delight!  I felt so so welcome by the experienced staff.  Well all I wanted was to open an account to bank with BANK_NAME and I was finally able to do so.I do like the way I was treated by BANK_NAME as a new customer.  They have shown me they care and value their customers.  I will not mind to bank my money in Summertown branch.  Just avoid Kidlington BANK_NAME that is. "
Customer_1640, Clearly does not value its loyal customers ," I was with BANK_NAME bank for 28 years and never went overdrawn and always had a good amount of money in my account. They always tried to get me to take out things I did not want or need they never once offered me what was best for me and my finances, they constantly pestered me on the phone despite me saying please do not contact me I will call in branch or phone when i need something. When I moved some money out of the account and transferred it into an ISA with another bank they told me I was stupid and that I would soon transfer it back. They offered me 0.5% interest and another bank offered me 3% despite  being a loyal customer. In June this year enough was enough and I switched my account to Santanders 123, the switch went very smoothly with no issue's and I am now earning decent interest and cash back and they do not hassle me at all. BANK_NAME have not once asked me why I was leaving or contacted me since, which I find very appalling. "
Customer_1641," HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! ...ONE BRANCH VISIT, 5 PHONE CALLS just for a name change.. and STILL NOT DONE!! "," I went into a branch to submit paperwork for a name change. Had to submit two separate name change forms because for some reason they had two separate profiles for me in their system (which the advisor at the branch said was a system error). One profile was for the credit card and the other was for the rest of my accounts. A week later, the name on my credit card was changed, new card received but no confirmation for any of my current and saving accounts. Call number 1 to the customer service number: They said they'd ask the branch to call me the same day or the next day. Call number 2: Three days later, a person from a branch called, but from an INCORRECT BRANCH. They then advised that they will get someone from the correct branch to call me this time. NO CALL from the correct branch. Call number 3: I called the customer service number. The person who helped got on the phone with their SPECIALIST DEPARTMENT"" who advised INCORRECT INFORMATION TWICE for the reason why the change hasn't happened. They finally concluded that the change was in progress and should be done in the next three days. They advised me to call back if it's not done in 3 days. At this point"
Customer_1642, YOU GUYS SUCK ," I went to open an account so initially started the application online , then went to the branch in bolton to show my id everything went ok then a couple of weeks later you cancel my application WTF "
Customer_1643, Non customers can't pay in at the tills!!!! , I went to pay money into my friends account and was told i could only pay at the deposit bank because i was not a customer. I said thats biast!! She said not really because customers take priority so they don't have to stand in a que....erm i am paying into your bloody bank into your customers account. How disgusting we have to pay else where. Utter disgrace!!!!!! 
Customer_1644, I wish i could give a Zero , I wish i could give a Zero. Everytime i log into my account its in negative.  I am far from Uk. It has been 10 months. And even if i am not making any transaction and always paying the overdraft for no reason it is still in minus. Deducting money for no reason. It is a Shame! 
Customer_1645, I wish I could have given no stars ," I wish I could have given no stars! I used to bank with BANK_NAME until, in their wisdom, they sold off my branch to TSB. The BANK_NAME branch that I regularly used was West Kirby so they know my face.Today I called in to exchange 50 pennies from my granddaughter's money box for a 50p piece. I was asked if I was a BANK_NAME customer and explained that I had been moved to TSB. The lady"" behind the counter told me to go to TSB to do the transaction. I explained that the nearest TSB branch to me was in Flint in North Wales. She replied"
Customer_1646, Lloyd's 10 year Customer Loyalty ," I would advise anyone to stay well away from BANK_NAME. The customers service is appalling, Merchant services a diabolical.  The process for Closure is a 3 step written letter notification which is clearly in favor of BANK_NAME and the merchant and designed to extort monies from clients if one of the step is is  missed etc. No customer loyalty applied, clear not our problem""! attitude. Terminated the service 14 months ago to switch to Worldpay as they are considerable cheaper.  Asked BANK_NAME to reduce fees"
Customer_1647, I would give them zero stars if I … ," I would give them zero stars if I could. The staff at the branch in London were very rude, useless and I decided to change banks. It's quite funny really as my monthly wage is the equivalent of at least 20 standard customers. Lots of business lost there because of your staffs lack of social skills. "
Customer_1648, stay away from BANK_NAME , I would say BANK_NAME is the worst bank in terms of business banking. 
Customer_1649," when you have a problem they don`t care, even after 20 years as a customer "," I`ve been with BANK_NAME for 20 years, my partner for 30. We had our first disputed payment with a garage that had not carried out the work that they had quoted for so we disputed the £400 credit card payment within minutes of it going through, the Section 75 team where obstructive and unhelpful to the point of stupidity (another garage carried out the work not done for £200 which was clearly shown on an invoice and also on a separate estimate as requested) however they choose to believe the original garage which said that the work not done would have cost £1,300 --- seriously would anyone pay £1,300 to have car carpet dried out ? It just all became too much effort, I really thought that BANK_NAME would have been on their customers side but they weren`t interested "
Customer_1650," Rotten bank, the worst I have used in 35 years. "," I'd like to share my experience of BANK_NAME.A few years ago I sold my home in the Euro Zone and transferred 300k € to the UK. As soon as the money arrived at BANK_NAME I moved it to their Super Saver account to get a bit of interest.First BANK_NAME gave me only £0.8537 per Euro instead of the average market rate for the day which was £0.8687; I lost £5280 on the exchange rate. Next BANK_NAME charged me a £5000 foreign exchange fee for receiving my money. Since my BANK_NAME current account didn't have £5000, I was hit with a £20 overdraft fee. So BANK_NAME got £5280+£5000+£20=£10300 of my hard earned cash. In return, after 4 months, I got £2.60 interest in their Easy Saver account. Oh yes, and whilst abroad, I couldn't access my account. When I did buy a house in the UK with the money, I had fly to the UK and visit a BANK_NAME branch just to get my money transferred to my solicitor.Rotten service and legalised day light robbery, the BANK_NAME black horse is there to trample over customers.I have gone back to First Direct and use Transfer Wise for foreign exchange transactions. very happy with both. "
Customer_1651, If i could give zero stars i would , If i could give zero stars i would.  Dealing with BANK_NAME bereavement services has been a nightmare.  It is like speakung to a brickwall.  Avoid if you have the choice and dont leave your loved ones to deal with BANK_NAME bank. 
Customer_1652, BANK_NAME have lost me as a customer ," If I could give zero stars I would. The worst customer service I've ever had, and that is really saying something when compared to some of the utility and cable companies over the years!I've just accepted a package to leave work, after 27 years hard work, but a a few glitches sorting out the payments by HR as an internal deadline was missed. A delay of a month. I thought just to be on the safe side I'd better warn BANK_NAME. I asked for a short term overdraft, just in case, should be fine but just to be on the safe side. The guy in the branch had to work from a computer which had already decided 'no'. I explained the large five figure amount coming into my account in the next month or so, the annuity that would be paid monthly in future as part of the agreement, the central London property I owned worth a high six figure amount, that I shouldn't even need to go overdrawn. The poor guy dealing with it, I felt so sorry for him, just said if it were his decision he would allow me the overdraft facility, but he's not allowed, the computer said 'no'. Even before I told him any of the facts.After over 30 years as a customer, I felt like at the point I needed BANK_NAME to be in my corner, a stupid computer programme ruled and  common sense was ignored. The facts were irrelevant, the computer says 'no'. It was like a surreal scene out of Little Britain as I sat in the recently refurbished bank branch with all shiny desks and designer chairs. Is this BANK_NAME response to the government bail out, a computer system to make all the decisions?I've already starting looking around for another bank…..lazy, lazy and sloppy….. "
Customer_1653, If I could give zero stars I would ," If I could give zero stars I would. Their telephone system is dreadful. Sent from one department to another, 45 minutes on phone getting nowhere except to probably fifth different person to be told that I would have to go back as they had not passed on adequate info and I would have to go back one step again to go forward. Then final phone operator put me on hold and left me for 10 minutes with, I believe clearly no intention of putting me through. No option but to hang up.  Worst experience ever "
Customer_1654, They're the bank that likes to say 'NO'. ," If you have an account with them, and you're paying a high interest rate. They'll keep increasing the rate until you can't afford it any more. If you ask for help, they will only say 'NO'. If you keep asking for help, they will send the police to your house. They're worse than useless. They're a liability. If I can't trust them with my debt; I certainly won't trust them with my money. "
Customer_1655, Ridiculous wait times ," If you love wasting your time while trying to get through to customer service then LBANK_NAME bank is the one for you.Went to park one day, had no change so went to pay by credit card. BANK_NAME declined the transaction. Ring them up, get answer in 15 minutes and told it is because it looked fraudulent. Then had to be put through to fraud team to resolve the issue. Waited for 45 minutes before hanging up and going to beg others for money.Over an hour to try and pay for parking and still unresolved. Try and send complaint form and just get an error message saying it can not be sent.BANK_NAME is a joke when it comes to customer service, which is a shame because everything else has been great. "
Customer_1656, Kicks you while you are down and doesn’t care about it. ," If you would like a bank that kicks you when you are down then this is the bank for you.Definitely not the bank that are for the journey or whatever they claim on their annoying Ad.Appalling.Even the online banking service is poor - god forbid if you wish to set up a standing order, was waiting 5 days days for a confirmation number by post that never came. Just don’t. "
Customer_1657, I'm a long standing BANK_NAME Bank … ," I'm a long standing BANK_NAME Bank customer and have been with them for longer than I can remember. I recently went to check my account and noticed I had been getting daily charges of about £1.50. I assumed my overdraft must have expired so I went to the bank with the intention of reapplying. However when I got there I was told my overdraft hadn't expired and they had simply introduced daily charges. I did a rough calculation and this now means I'll be paying well over double each month in charges for exactly the same overdraft I've had for years. I asked the lady I was talking to what my options were and she said there was nothing she could do and I would have to either pay the charges or pay off the overdraft. This is absolutely ridiculous and shows no care or concern for BANK_NAME customers. I told her I was unhappy and she said that lots of people had already closed down their accounts with them. I then decided to call a friend who works for BANK_NAME and he said they've been inundated with unhappy customers who's charges have now doubled, tripled, and some customers even more. I don't know why some regulatory board hasn't stepped in to stop this happening. This is complete robbery. I refuse to give a company like this my business so will be looking at options over the next day or 2 and hope to have my account closed by the end of the week. I also have a few business accounts with BANK_NAME and will be looking to move those also. Absolutely despicable business practice and I hope their affected customers will also take their business elsewhere. "
Customer_1658, Choose different ," I'm dissatisfied with the service, i went to bank 4 times to open a bank account and now they sent me letter saying they can't accept my id card as a proof of identity. i had to wait 10 days for this letter. Better choose different bank. "
Customer_1659, BANK_NAME Bank complaints process absolutely appalling , In all the years I have had Bank accounts the worst I have ever received is when I tried to log a complaint about the attitude of the Club BANK_NAME telephone handling team and their management. At the time of writing this I have been on the phone for 54 minutes being bounced around between BANK_NAME Bank departments refusing to even record a complaint 
Customer_1660, PPi Refund But I'm dead but I'm actually not ," In February I had a letter addressed to excusors of my estate regarding a Ppi refund additional payment. It's nearly April and I still haven't heard from BANK_NAME why there thought I was dead. I ring them three times a week and the customer complaints can't deal with the matter, I have seeked legal advice and BANK_NAME not getting away with this. I have three bank accounts with them all in the process of being closed. No customer service what so ever. Still never got an answer but the onbusman got involved and we had a financial settlement and my details were updated. "
Customer_1661, Worst business bank ever !!!! ," Incompetent managers, unprofessional and the worst experience of my business career take my advice do not bank with this lot it will only end up in tears. I escaped to Santander and they are at the other end of the spectrum not had any issues at all, they're cheaper and their business managers are exactly that and very professional. Save yourself all that grief and take on board what people on here are saying. "
Customer_1662, Poor inflexible currency service , Issued high denomination notes for a US dollar on $300 transaction even though they were aware we were going to the Caribbean. Travel sites recommend low denominations. I was told this was all the had in the vault; they would buy back at 10% premium and I should've read the T&Cs. T&Cs state that they will issue a mix of denominations. Inflexible when I asked to change and patronising too. 
Customer_1663, It has taken 6 months to open a … ," It has taken 6 months to open a business account but it is still not active, and am unable to add a new account to my existing online accounts. i am not surprised they have such a low rating. It is such a shame as I have been with them for years as a business customer and have had very good service. Unfortunately they have removed the business account team away from the main branch. All  no doubt done in the name of giving a better service, which is rubbish. "
Customer_1664," Online Banking, what online banking?! ", It often takes me multiple attempts to get to my online banking as the site is forever crashing. This drives me to distraction and totally destroys the idea that online banking makes life easier. Some days I can't log in at all. 
Customer_1665, It’s a nightmare ," It’s a nightmare! The worst customer service I've come across in my entire life in  BANK_NAME Bank 111 Woodfield St, Morriston, .I met a CUSTOMER SERVICE HORRIFIC STAFF, she was Grumpy rude, very bad service poorly treated with unwelcoming attitude.  This was like talking to a brick wall. Absolutely unprofessional and unhelpful for my problem.  I never go there again ! At last  I went to BANK_NAME Bank Oxford St, Swansea, the customer service staff Lewis was professional and helpful , he  dealt with my problem quickly and efficiently. "
Customer_1666, Telephone support - or not! ," Its Friday 14th October 2016 at 6:20PM. I have now been waiting for someone to speak to at BANK_NAME Business bank for 1hr 55mins. I'm only hanging on now to make sure they know how pi**ed off I am - I've forgotten the primary purpose of the call! Besides, I've come this far - I want to get to the 2hrs!As a result, after 40 years with BANK_NAME I do think it could be time for a change, if only to free up the phone lines for others! "
Customer_1667, Customer since i was 4!...time to move on ," Its our own fault if we keep dormant bank accounts open that pay no interest.Why should we expect banks to tell customers of over 40 years that they can earn more money in a different account?After all they are banks,they just want to pay you as little as possible on your savings to make sure they can pay themselves fat bonuses.If the going gets tough they can always split themselves or have a merger and if thats not enough just get bailed out.The only way to get a better deal on your money is to play them at their own game.No loyalty and just keep switching. "
Customer_1668, An unethical and immoral company that has caused suffering to animals ," I've banked with BANK_NAME for 25 years so I'm in a position to inform people what they are getting involved with if they choose to bank with BANK_NAME...They were good at first but have rapidly gone down hill over the years whereby I would describe them as unethical, immoral and they have no interest in providing a service, they're just interested in getting your money and as much of it as they possibly can.I could go on but let me point out 3 of the most important points/ experiences I've had with these people and make upyour own mind...1. They allowed fraud to be committed on my account whereby £1600 of charity money went to a TSB account (their sister company) yet Action Fraud say they couldn't do anything because they could not get the details of the receiving bank. This is because BANK_NAME would not help. They neither refunded and did not respond to a written complaint. They obviously do not care about the suffering that has been caused to abused animals and there are reports of crookedly in that this has happened to other people.2. They left me stranded abroad and would not help even though it was their mistake they stopped my account. I had to use my return ticket to fly back and sort the problem out because they left me with literally zero money. They offered me £50 compensation. Again, they couldn't care less.3. They hard sell and I opened a new account elsewhere so I could bank in peace. One of their employees who was trying to sell me insurance took me into a room and gave me the story of how her niece died of cancer and that yes, cancer does affect people my age to get me to buy the policy! There is a distinct difference between the working practices of BANK_NAME and my main bank First Direct. Just the way BANK_NAME manage bank accounts and your transactions is all tailored to cream as much money from you as possible.First Direct do not do this.Today myself and two business friends have closed our accounts because of this and as a result BANK_NAME have lost £500k between us and I will continue to inform people what BANK_NAME has done.Don't make the mistake banking with BANK_NAME.

Customer_1669, Time to Move On ," I've been a BANK_NAME customer for 45 years (an achievement in itself). After the death of my dear wife in 2000 I was persuaded to invest some capital with BANK_NAME Private Banking. At that point LPB maintained a local office and my personal fund manager was just a phone call or email away. Home visits to discuss my portfolio were routine, enjoyable and constructive.  The home visits then stopped and a number of different fund managers followed who had no real idea who I was. The local office was then closed and everything devolved to a more regional office - albeit with a phone number to contact my fund manager of the day (no email). The service has now devolved still further to a Head Office based in Bristol  where contact is with a Relationship Associate who does not know me at all. There is no email service and phone calls are on an 0845 number when you can get through. On the occasion I did make contact the Associate was unable to give me advice on a critical issue and promised a return call. No call was made and I had to communicate with a letter. BANK_NAME Private Banking claim to provide a 24/7 service but I have no evidence of this. My LPB current account gathers zero interest but there are no bank charges. There are a few perks - free travel insurance, cheap AA membership, mobile phone and card protection. I cannot transfer my account freely to another BANK_NAME account. Worst of all there is no on-line access to my LPB Portfolio. In this respect BANK_NAME are living in the dark ages and can only provide paper based reports twice a year. This is frankly useless in what is now a fast moving connected modern world.My LPB Managed Portfolio is converting slowly to Select ISA using the maximum yearly allowance for this. Consequently the BANK_NAME Managed Account is reducing in size but the bank charges as a % of the Managed Account have increased to over 2%. The % charge for all assets is flat at around 1.25%. Essentially - the bank takes all my dividend on which I have to pay tax. Nice deal for the bank. This is a big slice of the action - but for what? Growth in simple terms has been around 5-6% pa over the past 4 years. Not exactly earth shattering. I've had enough. This weekend I have applied to transfer my current account to Santander Bank (branch just down the road). With advise from an independent  financial adviser known to the family for several generations (did well for my mum and dad) - I will be transferring out my LPB Portfolio as soon as possible. In this way I will have control of my financial affairs. Goodbye BANK_NAME Bank.  Shame on you. "
Customer_1670, Positive review ," I've been reading the reviews and I'm honestly shocked, BANK_NAME has been a great bank to me personally. Had no issues with them whatsoever and a few times I have ended up on an unplanned overdraft by mistake, they waved the fee without a thought. I don't know if its just cause of my location but I cant recommend this bank enough. "
Customer_1671, Not on par with other banks ," I've been using BANK_NAME online banking for several years now and have always felt frustrated by its incompetence.  They have just updated their website with a new design.  I was really excited that I may be able to do things I could never do before as you can with other banks but no such luck.  The only difference is the layout and everything is bigger.  There don't appear to be any new features and I'm very disappointed.  If it wasn't for the amount of work it would create, I would be changing banks.  Get with the time BANK_NAME. "

Customer_1673, not helpful ," I've been with BANK_NAME for 8 years nearly now and I have to say that they have certainly not been 'there for the journey' as per their advert. I know that I haven't got the best credit file but through out the years I've applied for loans, credit cards, overdrafts and to date not been accepted for anything from them for when I needed it the most.When I was 19 my car insurance was over £2000 and I had to rely on my brother to get me a loan, or relied on other people (which by the way is very embarrassing) and I have paid every single person back.But what kind of bank doesn't even give u a chance over 8 years, my credit history isn't even that bad so this pretty much says that their acceptance criteria is set quite high. They could of earnt probably a lot of money out of me but I've now finally given up and looking for a new current account elsewhere. Thanks BANK_NAME "

Customer_1677," Does not care, Will Not listen "," Like a fool, i bought some tickets for a concert and paid by bank transfer, this was not off of a site.So when it all went wrong, i contacted the police and went to my bank to make them aware of the problem.I did not go to the bank to ask them to rectify this, i simply went there to let them know that i had paid money to a fraudster, now when i got into the branch and explained what i had done, i was handed a phone and a number to call, after being put through to several service employees on the phone, i was then told something which i could not make out on the phone as it was a bad line and the service employee had a strong accent, then the line went dead.I then spoke to a member of staff in the branch, and the answer i got was, nothing to do with the bank, we cannot help you.Now it was not help i was in the bank for, it was to give the information on the fraudster, but nobody wanted to know, they didn't even take down my name or account number, or even want to know the name of the fraudsters account or bank.I know it was my fault for falling for a scam, but you are always told to report these things to help build profiles of criminals, so if anything like this this happens to you, don't bother going to a BANK_NAME bank to let them know as they could not care less.Especially the Enfield branchMandy "
Customer_1678, BANK_NAME Bank ," Like all Banks they never make mistakes, faultless service, offer a lot of bank related products, Property and Contents Insurance excellent, Had occasion to claim on my insurance some years ago, very professionally handled, Savings products not so good due to low interest rates and capped amounts you can save, but that's in line with all other Banks. But were they could improve is their automated phone service. When you eventually can direct yourself to an advisor, it takes for ever to get them to answer. The other day Phoned them about a maturing savings account, Waited for best part of thirty minutes, still no answer. mmmmm !!!!!! Think I'll do it online, At least their Website is very User Friendly "
Customer_1679, happy with their reliable trustworthy service ," like it says.. they are reliable and trustworthy. I have never had problems with security on their online website, which is the most important thing whilst online banking. the only reason why i have marked them down a star is because sometimes, temporarily, the online site will crash and wont let you into your online page. This has dissapointed me a few times as I have tried to check my balance at a very important time (ie when direct debits had come out and i needed to check my balance) and could not log in.apart from this very good!

I made a complaint because they set up a min payment on my Credit Card and then started whacking on charges that exceeded my monthly payment, leaving me in a debt hole I couldn't get out of. I tried to explain about this and the extortionate charges on my overdraft and the complaints advisor just didn't care and continued rhyming off T+C's.

Do I really want to be giving them further information when they do not operate within the rules.

I rang telephone banking only to be told I hadn't registered for telephone banking so they couldn't set up a new recipient. I spoke to the manager and she also refused to set up a new recipient. When I challenged them on their refusal to allow me access to my money they told me if I didn't like it I could bank elsewhere and hung up on me.I would highly recommend banking elsewhere.I will be following their advice and doing so myself.

I said to her thanks for this my mum has just died and I'm all over the place. She said and I quote  I don't care."" I said sorry what did you say did you hear what I said? She nodded grinning and I was so stunned I didn't know what to do.. I burst into tears like a buffoon. I was so upset and her colleague got me and shoved me through the door. I was on crutches too.

This is not convenient as every month I need to pay my workers I would need to go through a very long process of using a card reader with 3passwords to pay my workers! I have to start the week before to make sure everyone is paid on time. Utter rubbish... Phone them requesting a debit card & was declined, asked for a reason question what there is no reason.

Back to the helpdesk and they were unable to offer any explanation other than my account hadn't been used much recently.  This is rubbish, my account has been  used as frequently as ever. My past experience of BANK_NAME leads me to believe this is another ploy to get me into the branch so one of their awful bank staff can give me the aggressive sales pitch that BANK_NAME employ on their customers.  I will be moving banks next week - to a provider most people seem to be moving to now and who seem to manage to be successful without using these underhand techniques.

Have found a 0800 number but its hidden on the complaints page but makes no difference as there is still a long wait to talk to someone,One of the main reasons might be that they did not pay peoples salaries in on time this month so many people are upset.Makes no difference the customer service is absolute rubbish!

Customer_1708, Trying to open a basic bank account , My Wife has attempted to open just a basic bank account at BANK_NAME. She has a Romanian passport and I am British we have just moved back to the UK four months ago. My wife has a job here and needed a bank account for her salary. We initially tried to open a bank account at the branch in Kingsbridge Devon where my mother is located and where we were staying and were told quite adamantly that she had the necessary documents to open the account. We organised an interview for the next day where she was then told that the documentation that they agreed to the day before was not adequate (they checked with the manager). We have since moved to London but wanted to continue trying to open this account. We were told at the branch in Wimbledon that an employee letter from her employer added to the documentation already requested would be enough by a member of staff at the bank we provided the documentation and got a rejection in opening the bank account. We were then told that we needed to have a utility bill or council tax bill. We provided the council tax bill for our apartment in Wimbledon and were told again in the branch that this would be enough to open the account and today my wife has got another rejection letter and the bank refuses to say why. So we still have nowhere to put her salary which has now been accumulating for three months. It seems that the staff in the branches are working from a different set of rules from those somewhere else. This situation is totally unacceptable and just shows how incompetent this organisation is.

What do you think, that it was happening in the same day?The lady from the bank ( By the way ST.ALBANS , Hertfordshire Branch) called me and she was telling me that, the account is not valid; and it should be closed by the reasons like : the letter from the employer is not good, the address witch I give is not credible, and..... ,,for Romanian citizens, the formalities are totally different from the rest of the European people and for the Polish people it`s much easy.`` (It will much easy for me, if I`ll my name  and passport with a polish one?).It`s funny, isn`t it?After a day, some guy from the same branch called me and he was putting me some questions. It was also frustrating.I came here, in UK, to make my studies, I got a job, I pay taxes and I`m actually respect this land and his people; and I really respect the law. But being honest, with good sense, I`m just ,,a toy in the racist machine``.If I was doing other things, to win money, or my living, I might didn`t have to have an account in any bank, do I?It is better if this Bank, this company, will put, in the front of the main door the same sign, like the shops did in the age of 60`s(,,No Irish, No pakis and No dogs``). Today will sound like: ,,No Romanians, No Bulgarians, No Latvians - if they are honorable people and with good sense, or if they want to prove their respect for the Quinn and Country!``By the way, after this story, I don`t know how sure I might be, about all the personal information`s I have give to this bank and about the privacy, that my name and the copies of my documents will not be used in other purposes.

BANK_NAME advised to email them the details of the payment i made to the company and also the email i sent to the company asking for a refund which i did immediately.  I did not recieve any reply to my email until the the 8th of September. In their reply, they asked for the same information i had forwarded in my first email on the 2nd.That alone was so annoying and frustrating. But I still went ahead and resent the information. When i did not get any response to my email, i rang them again on the 16th which was 2 weeks down the line. I was told they were still investigating and would get back to me.This is horrible customer service especially from such a Bank. You rely on them and trust them to sort you out and yet they let you down.I am considering taking my accounts away to a more serious and customer focused Bank. "
Customer_1714, On the 30th of November I received the … ," On the 30th of November I received the money of 50GBP from my brother into my account which I instantly transferred into my mums BANK_NAME saving account. Today I noticed that on the 1st of December I have been charged 6.65GBP for an overdraft of 50GBP that I never did. It might be an error with their system but it is an error they should have instantly corrected. Furthermore, I spent 1 hour on the phone today, waiting for someone to talk to and had to hang up the phone as I was running out of credit. I even heard that they have done the same to other customers on the news, worst bank ever. "
Customer_1715, One of the best banks around , One of the best banks around. Excellent customer service and they deal with fraud very efficiently and seriously. 
Customer_1716, bank charges conned , one star if I could i would not give them any stars been in this bank for years was first in t.s.b then they joined up with BANK_NAME then BANK_NAME went it alone since then I have been charged with the most stupidest of charges 3p overdrawn 70p overdrawn yet had plenty of money in other accounts its a digusting bank avoid it at all costs I am leaving this bank shortly as soon as I sort out another mortgage lender . 
Customer_1717, utter rubbish ," online banking does not work, it always asks me for more numbers than are in my memorable information, it's being doing this since November, i could not speak to them via phone because of security reasons.......... even though i gave her enough information about me. she said ``i can not help you because somebody might be standing behind you watching``, i told her i was at home, this went on for quite some time until i finally lost my cool and slammed down the phone.this much security is just plain stupid, in many ways it looks very dumb as well, because it's pretty obvious that i am who i say i ami have to go to the petrol station to check my account, this bank is now rubbish i'll switch my account to somewhere else...it's still not working two weeks later "
Customer_1718, Online Banking is easy to use and staff … , Online Banking is easy to use and staff in my local branch are always helpful. I have had good experiences with the bank including setting up Apple Pay. 
Customer_1719, Good website , Online banking with their website is easy. 
Customer_1720, Only banked with these for 5 days ," Only banked with these for 5 days, most disgusting service I have ever had. In the process of switching back to old bank. What a joke “on your side” only side there on is lining there own pockets. Do not bank with them if you value your money. "
Customer_1721, Branch Service Great - Head Office Dreadful! ," Our local BANK_NAME branch in Coventry provide us with outstanding service but we have had a long running dispute with the Head Office over miss-selling, going all the way back to 2007. Their treatment of us has been quite dreadful and very dismissive, to the point of being rude, arrogant and very unfriendly. We have now taken our complaint to the Ombudsman, something that we never wanted to do, and once resolved we will I'm afraid be taking our business elsewhere. Why on earth would we want to stay? "
Customer_1722, Outrages overdraft charges ," Outrages overdraft charges, poor account options with overpriced fees. They do not value your custom at all. What's worse is the complaints department have got to be the rudest snobbish idiots I have dealt with. All to line the big bonuses for the guys at the top. If you have sense stay clear! "
Customer_1723, Paid by DD for BANK_NAME home emergency… , Paid by DD for BANK_NAME home emergency ins along with home insuranceRecent bad weather claimed on emergency  ins for no heating and a week later no engineerPhoned to cancell both policies due to loss of faith in BANK_NAME policies told I would incur charges as home insurance was not at fault and would have to contact Royal sun alliance re the emergency cover as they were underwriters .MY POINT  BANK_NAME sold me both policies so should be liable I wanted to cancel policies without any charges so I could go elsewhere Not possible ???? 
Customer_1724, You can't trust a bank you can't keep track of ," Paying for things with my card and phone simple but keeping track impossible!It takes weeks even months for transactions to show, and when that do it's wrong date wrong time may as well be different year because if you make as many different payments as me it really is just a mind field!I think if the date of payments don't co inside with when they where made the bank should forfeit as they are technically committing fraud!Don't use BANK_NAME untrustworthy "
Customer_1725, Probably no worse than other banks but so poor , Probably no worse than other banks - I don't know waited 50 minutes on a  holding line to transfer money!!  I hung up and wondering where else I can take it . I also deeply resent being  told that BANK_NAME Bank operators are 'busy' . I am busy too !!Never mind 'busy' They have simply failed to employ enough people to serve their customers. 
Customer_1726, Raising overdraft charges from 1% to 4% … ," Raising overdraft charges from 1% to 4% is simply extortion and daylight robbery. Add to that when I called customer services to query this (as it meant my charges going from £37 to £130 per month), the utter disgrace of an advisor told me Well that is what it's going to be"
Customer_1727, Salford shopping branch , Really rude and horrible customers service never ever going back there . Especially for Bussines customers avoid that branch 
Customer_1728, Local banking? , Really upset with how my branch manager spoke to me. Raised voice and spoke to me like a 3 year old. Turned to TSB for a small personal loan but it was declined. I wrote a letter to the manager asking for help and advice on a future mortgage and an inheritance going through probate and I hand delivered it to my local branch; I heard nothing for 3 days before I chased it up and I received a phone call from the manager demanding why had I sent a letter to them and why I contacted them in particular. I felt humiliated and embarrassed and tearfully and quietly hung up. Their photo is displayed in branch offering their assistance; this is terribly misleading. I have been a customer for over 10 years; does this not demonstrate some financial stability? Local banking? Being given a telephone number for customer service is not local banking. I look forward to closing my account and I have changed my mind about asking you to provide my future mortgage! I currently have a bank account with TSB (not for too much longer) and a new loan with another provider.Also I have had a lot of issues with Clicksafe not allowing me to purchase online; during a recent online purchase the 3D box popped up urging me to contact my bank to sort and enable future purchases to go through. So I rang TSB and the lady doesn't know what Clicksafe is...she tells me it's a server error with the retailer..reluctantly I do as she says and call the retailer who is just as confused as I am. So I Facebook message TSB (I'm not going through another phone conversation at this point) and explain to them that there is an awful lot of info on Clicksafe on the website but nowhere does it tell you what to do! Answer? Call customer service. 
Customer_1729, Recently opened up an account , Recently opened up an account with BANK_NAME.Received my card and pin number through the post. Gave my new details to my employer for my wages to be paid in then a few days later I went to a cash machine to withdraw money only for my card to be retained. Went into the branch where I opened my account and had to wait 40 minutes to be seen only to be told after further checks they can't offer me an account but didn't know a reason why.Resulted in me not getting paid that week and then getting taxed higher the week later due to a double wage. 
Customer_1730, Interest Rate Hike of 60% !! ," Recvd correspondence advising my interest rate on an agreed overdraft was to be centralised ( i.e increased by 60%) . Spent an hour on the phone as usual being passed from person to person , complaints handlers response was basically if you don't like it .....tough, thats our decision.When I responded that if I told my customers their costs were to increase by 60% she didn't get the analogy or chose not to . Seems to me that now they are no longer receiving state help ( without which they would have collapsed in 2009) they feel able to shaft customers as they see fit. "
Customer_1731, Fraudulent bank! , Send money and we'll release your money that block. It is our security policy.From the account to an account in the EU.What is it?It does not correct the bank.I do not recommend !!! Attention!!! 
Customer_1732, Shocking bank!!!! , Shocking bank!!!!Took £388 out of my fiances bank for a loan payment even after we had manually paid the payment 1 week prior. This left us unable to pay rent and now means we could be facing eviction!!!Thank you BANK_NAME for causing so much stress and trouble! 
Customer_1733, Shocking customer service , Signed up for a new business account with 18 months free banking and then £5 per month thereafter unless we did non-electronic transactions.  As soon as the 18 months was up they started charging us for everything including electronic transactions.Have tried to sort this out with them over the phone and have to date called 4 times and keep being given the run around.Still not resolved.

Customer_1736, The Fawlty Towers of banks. Awful service. ," So I joined BANK_NAME Bank 2 months ago having previously banked for 30 years with Santander. Now I'm regretting changing.  In the last two months there have been a catalogue of mistakes made by this bank and I'm truly shocked at how bad it is as I thought BANK_NAME were a reputable business. Staff are incompetent and each time I have called them to fix a problem I get conflicting advice from each advisor, which then turns out to be wrong. My numerous calls to their customer helpline have equated to up to 4 hours worth of phone costs as you wait 10 minutes on hold to be answered  before  half an hour further wait whilst you're passed from one department to another as no-one seems to be able to help with the simplest of problems. I have been compensated each time which is fair enough but this simply seems to be so they can close the complaint down as in their opinion it's been resolved, this is all well and good but the mistakes keep happening one after another!!   I opened the account online and at the same time applied for an overdraft. All went through fine. Then two days before the switch I receive a letter from BANK_NAME telling me that I've gone into an unauthorised overdraft and will be charged. My account hasn't even gone live yet!! When I questioned this they said the £17 charge per month for the account had already been taken and as I don't have an overdraft this results in a fee.  I explained I had applied and been accepted for an overdraft at the time of setting up the account they checked and established the overdraft had indeed been applied for but not been processed possibly due to a glitch on the website at the time"".   I was compensated and an apology given.  I then had to call repeatedly to ask for my welcome pack and insurance policy details - after the third call I was compensated again and three weeks after the account going live I finally received my information pack. I applied for a cheque book which never arrived. I then stupidly changed my name to my married name and needed my cards updated to reflect this. This request seemed to be beyond their skill set as two new cards were issued to me with the wrong details on. After me chasing this finally at least one account card was sent with the correct details on. The card to my second account  however never arrived and when I chased this they stopped all my cards which left me stranded in central London with no access to funds!!  At the time of the call the operator assisting me seemed so incompetent I double checked the right card was being cancelled and she assured me that was the case three times. Hey presto 6 hours later no cards linked to my account will work.  I now have to wait 5 days to get access to new cards and my funds.  Absolutely disgusting level of incompetence. After just 8 weeks with them I'm closing my account and moving to a proper bank. Don't bother with them!! """
Customer_1737, Using Mental Illness to sell products ," So I used to be with BANK_NAME, I'm so glad I'm not now. I've just seen a tv advert for BANK_NAME bank using mental illness to sell their products!!!! Absolutely disgusting!!!! SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!! "

Customer_1739, Someone keeps setting up direct debits … ," Someone keeps setting up direct debits under my business account. I rang up for the 3rd time to report it and I was told there is nothing they can do about it. The only option I was given was to spend 40 minutes over the phone setting up a whole new bank account....they already have all my details, why do I need to answer all the same questions and provide ID for a new bank account?I said I did not want to spend my time on the phone doing this, they said bye and that was it. Someone out there has stolen my bank details and keeps spending my money and BANK_NAME are not even bothered. I just have to call up every week to get refunds and cancel the new direct debits...no wonder the world is in such a mess "
Customer_1740, Very bad service as I was promised the VAT returned ," Still waiting for the return of the VAT I paid on a new bed for my mother, she is suffering from cancer doctors now say only week left not months, bed not even been used after first trial of two hours, now in storage. Will never use you again.B M Jones "
Customer_1741, Talk about scams and rip offs. ," Talk about scams and rip offs.Banked with BANK_NAME Bank for nearly 40 years. Had a overdraft facility all that time and it has been useful.Got letter recently.Part of it says:We are writing to you to let you know you have recently used your Planned Overdraft. You pay a daily overdraft fee of Ip for every full £7.00 for each full day that you are using your Planned Overdraft over any fee free amount.""This makes as much sense as a chocolate teapot.Go to bank. After some discussion and perplexity on both sides:""Well Mr Hill it means that it's costing you an interest rate of about 54% on the amount you are presently overdrawn"".54%!!!Overdraft paid off and account being closed. """
Customer_1742, This bank is a joke , Terrible services through the phone as well aa in the banks branch and ridiculous fees for overdraft and credit card. When it comes to give you credit card or overdraft they are first at your doors but when it comes to any help there is none to help you. Be carefully taking any insurance from them and any of their special account plans or any features because you will pay ridiculous amount per month and when it comes to claim you are being laught in the face. I have also been lied by the person setting up my insurance and when I opened the case against him he slip of it nicely like a fish... Stay away from them. For your own safety.. 
Customer_1743, Thanks , Thanks to BANK_NAME Debit card disputes department for their swift application of the 'chargeback' facility. After having money stolen by ToolAndFix.com one phone call to the bank yesterday afternoon put my mind at rest. This morning The Bank!! Gave me the money back less than 24 hours later. 'Chargeback' spread the word. 
Customer_1744, very bad experiences of this bank ," The abuse given me by this,bank has been intolerable.  Today, the manager in Birkenhead branch refused to arrange a meeting and shouted out in front of all the customers that I was not allowed an overdraft.  I will be sending in a formal complaint.  I will be contacting the financial ombudsman to lodge a complaint against them.  I am not accepting any compensation from BANK_NAME.  Their behaviour is disgusting.  Other banks have agreed with me that they have a bad reputation, and have told me that they get heavily fined if the financial ombudsman has to investigate. "
Customer_1745, A phone nightmare , The amount of stress and time wasted in the calls with their robots is endless. I don't even remember all the flaws and issues I experienced with their phone service.Dumbest phone service I have ever experienced globally.

Customer_1747, The best Bank that i ever have … , The best Bank that i ever have been...Much better than Hsbc....Really proud that i choose them cause they offer good services and good customers service 
Customer_1748, Nightmare ," The company I work for changed owners so the new bosses bank with this rubbish bank. Every Bacs; Chaps ; fast or intenartional payment shows as Direct Debit on that statement. And guess what, direct debit payment are names that too. There is no name for the company you paid or received money from,the payment reference it's gone.  Also USD payment from a USD account would cost you a fortune. Every time you pay someone and the payment was set up to SHARE the bank charges, the bank  (BANK_NAME ) deducts $30 from the amount paid so basically you underpay each supplier by $30 so get ready for complains. That happens because BANK_NAME does not have a link to USA/Canada/any other country  for payment USD and Canadian dollars payment, so basically they are using and intermediary bank to make the payment and they charge you for something you should not pay. A rip off. Run for you life and do not bank with this guys. BANK_NAME is great, never had a problem. "
Customer_1749, The BANK_NAME Bank on Commercial Road … ," The BANK_NAME Bank on Commercial Road (opposite the McDonalds) is absolutely horrendous. There is only ever one counter open, even when the queue is very long and the woman serving there most afternoons (Manju Sethi) is extremely slow and arrogant. After people are made to wait 20-30 minutes while she takes her time at a snail’s pace, she attempts to fob you off and makes paying-in to an account like you are some sort of criminal and tells you she will do it this time, even when it IS something that is part of her job and the only way to do it is at the counter, when it involves coins, neatly bagged and counted for her. All she has to do is weigh the bags and deposit the balance, we’re talking about something that would take her less than 2 minutes.After the death stare, she explained that at BANK_NAME “You are not allowed to pay-in to someone else account” (especially your spouses), apparently the rules have recently changed. What utter nonsense, I’ve been doing it for years and l and others I know have done it many times at the same branch and other banks to without ANY issues.I asked to speak to a manager, as I didn’t quite like her attitude, she jumped out of her seat and disappeared for 10 minutes (guess she was briefing her colleague to repeat what she said) Anyway, out comes this guy (think his name was Eddie McNally), he tells me “I was being a naughty boy”, and proceeded to talk over me, when I got a chance to speak I explained that her customer services needed improvement and that she was being very rude. He ignored that and said he hadn’t witnessed anything so she hadn’t done anything wrong. At this point I thought I was wasting my breath on this non-entity, so ignored him mid sentence and walked out of the branch -  complaining to head office might be more useful. Avoid these amateurs, they don’t have a clue about how to treat loyal customers. "
Customer_1750, BANK_NAME Website as a Windows 7 Phone app ," The BANK_NAME website is very cool looking and so easy to use.  I would really like BANK_NAME to make an app for the Windows 7 phone, so I can do basic functions like balance checking and making payments / transfers using my phone. "
Customer_1751, The most appalling service ever ," The most appalling service ever, having changed job and moved to monthly pay I asked for assistance due to cash shortfall, totally rejected as no payment has been transferred yet by new employer , have had wages paid in weekly for over ten years, appalling "
Customer_1752, The most convenient online banking … , The most convenient online banking system for me. Couldn't believe that it'd be possible to get my loan approved online and within a few hours. The system is very secure and self manageable. 
Customer_1753, The most shockingly idiotic people in … , The most shockingly idiotic people in the world! Having an account with BANK_NAME is like loaning money to a friend who is known to not pay money back. I tried to make a transfer from my account and was told everything is OK. Got a reference number. Three days later the money has not left my account. Called them. Wait 2 minutes. Wait 3 minutes. Wait 2 minutes. In the end they could not tell me why the money has not left the account and told me they will call me back! That is unacceptable! IT IS MY F%$KING MONEY! They act like they are it's theirs with their stupid 'can't do anything' attitude. There are banks in third world countries that are more reliable and trustworthy than these jokers. As soon as possible I am transferring my money and closing my account. Idiots. 
Customer_1754, Daily fee for an authorised overdraft ," The new daily fee for an authorised overdraft, in addition to sky-high interest rates, is sheer daylight robbery on the part of BANK_NAME Bank. I am amazed the Regulator has not intervened to ban this practice outright. "
Customer_1755, Online banking new structure absolute garbage ," The new super dooper internet banking is launched and believe me it wants launching, horrible, not user friendly and takes longer to access than the old system. Absolute rubbish, I  phoned customer service who had no idea how to navigate it either. Try sorting your direct debit by date, it doesn't work, reply oh yes we know about that. I cant see my pending transaction, let us check, reply we can, that's no use to me I need to see them, reply oh yes. What a mess !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
Customer_1756, Good and Bad! ," The online banking service is fantastic and deserves a 5 star rating. Customer service staff are really nice but getting things done falls short hence the reason for only giving a 3 star rating.  Had assurance that a DD that had left my account would be returned to me within 24 hours.... that was last Friday and I am still waiting for the money to appear, no notes on my account of me ever having been in touch with them either?  It will be interesiting to see if they are going to heap charges on my account???  Not a happy bunny............... "
Customer_1757, THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!!! ," THE WORST BANK EVER!!!!!!!!All wrong with this bloody far too expensive bank! Always only issues with them! Extremely poor customer services nearly everytime I'm there. They also didn't want to offer me any benefit of using an account even I'm a full time student, but the worst thing is I came to Canada for a few months stay and I'm unable to use my card! Even it's saying I can use it! When I contact the UK number which is very expensive, it's asking me to wait 5 minutes on the line after robotic voice talking to me for 3 minutes making me spend lots of money on them again! So unhelpful!!! USELESS!!!! Don't never ever recommend! NEVER!!!! "
Customer_1758, The worst bank ever ," The worst bank ever. They making huge changes on my account without informing me... Charges out of nowhere, my credit card limit decreased without saying a word, blocking my account for no reason... Such a bank"" shouldn't even exist. ONE BIG JOKE.! """
Customer_1759, online application process is a joke ," Their online application process is a joke. You spend ~30 minutes giving them ALL possible data about yourself (they event want your mother's maiden name!) and filling in the most ridiculous aptitude test"" where there are no real ""winning"" answers (you are presented with some possible scenarios of what could happen at work and expected to choose 2 answers - the thing you'd be most likely to do and the way you'd be least likely to react - most of the answers sound reasonable so you are somewhat forced to mark one of them as ""unreasonable"" - your ""least likely to do""). At the end you are told that ""unfortunately"

Customer_1761, closed another local branch , they call it progress!!i dontfed up with them 
Customer_1762, Awful awful awful , They can't get anything right and make communicating with them as difficult and time consuming as possible. When something goes wrong (which is often) they are beyond apathetic and fixing it is painful. Awful. 
Customer_1763, stole my money , they just took money from my account..never to get it back .. 
Customer_1764, Absolutely horrendous bank , They sent me a defective card which was a huge inconvenience as I was forced to use my Canadian card and thus charged a heavy service fee for every use. They give poor instructions. Their internet banking is also terrible to use. I hate the memorable information question they ask every single time you try to use it. It's a great inconvenience. I will be switching from this bank asap and will not recommend it to anyone. Lloyd's is a very inconsiderate and poorly run bank. The tellers are alright but everything else is crap. 
Customer_1765, Disgusting insurance provider ," They were charging my mother over £300 more for home and contents insurance, than a quote with them online, for years. She was not aware that they were charging for £5000 shed cover and for her making a claim within the last three years, which they were aware she had not, as she had been with them for longer than that period. When I realised this and contacted them they could not care less. I was sent a letter with numerous irrelevant excuses and then a leaflet to complain to the ombudsman.My mother has been with BANK_NAME bank for over 40years and so trusted in them. It is worrying to think how many people that are not use to using the internet or comparison sites that BANK_NAME are taking advantage off, because they trust in their bank.I hope everyone that has been mistreated by BANK_NAME makes a complaint to the ombudsman so hopefully they are forced to change their ways.

"
Customer_1768, Far behind the times ," This bank is very poor and I do not know why people continue to bank here. They offer no incentives such as rewards and if you have an overdraft you are financially Exploited  by them. Don’t know why people don’t just leave and move elsewhere it’s so easy. This bank will be suffering soon, watch this space!! "
Customer_1769, Using BANK_NAME when abroad ," Three examples of poor service......When arranging currency for a trip to Switzerland, the BANK_NAME staff member was adamant that Switzerland used the euro for their currency..!!!When having a debit card 'swallowed up' by an ATM abroad (Middle East country), we called BANK_NAME international desk for assistance. The staff member said go into the bank as it wasn't a weekend. The fact that the weekend in most Middle East countries is different to UK weekends seemed to not register with the staff member.Obtaining emergency currency while abroad., BANK_NAME has a partnering arrangement with another company. The process was the currency would be delivered to our hotel....it wasn't and we requested to go to a outlet of their partner company. Having gone around a large city for an hour, the taxi driver who knew most of the city well declared he had never heard of the company outlet. We then walked around and by chance saw a outlet which arranged currency exchanges. As I looked over the service counter of the place I asked if they knew where the BANK_NAME partner company outlet was. They didn't know. Then I pointed out that the paper of theirs letterhead was the name of the company!!!!Another time arriving at Nairobi after an internal flight from Mombassa (just escaped the riots!)., I wanted to withdraw funds from an airport ATM ....I had a problem. I called BANK_NAME international desk. They asked me security questions one of which, how much cash I had taken out of my account on a date 2 weeks prior!,, no consideration that we had just escaped the middle of an ensuing al Shabab riot!!!BANK_NAME ....international support....forget it.....you're on your own....

As i ask for it and they told me i could not do that as i was a new customer.. now i have a 105 pounds debt. Because  of the first 5 pounds i was under.. they gave me money that i diddent ask and claimed intrests on that.. stay away from them people.. !! 
Customer_1772, TOP in my opinion! ," Top in WORST banks!Snobbish, unethical and incompetant branch staffs. First, I am a customer but I was left feeling that I need to beg them to approve the opening of my account.

They 'forgot' our application, and when I phoned them they rushed through the application - resulting in all manor of issues including wrong names, no chequebook, no paying in book, no chip and pin.To top it off, one of their so called advisor put the phone down on me (after passing their security checks so he could here me, and spoke to me) after I had been transferred from another department. Call was from 9am 18/09/2015 .Absolutely the worst time at a bank ever. Should have gone to BANK_NAME like we did last time, up and running within 2 weeks with no hassle! "

Customer_1777, tryed to phone em about unauthorized… , tryed to phone em about unauthorized transaction they keep asking stupid questions to veryfiy me I get less question in past now theres like 5 or 10 questions and then half the time they say cant help you. shower of ba45tards. 
Customer_1778, Very unprofessional ," Two of my friends who just moved to London asked me which bank they could use and I suggested BANK_NAME because their application looked pretty simple, I now regret it so much! We did the application online, pretty simple, we went to the branch in Piccadilly Circs and that's where our nightmare started! One the employers reviews the proof of address which is the employer's letter and she says very rudely that it's not good, we needed to put a date in there and an address confirmation, I ask her then if there's anything else I need to know and she says that it will be ok after that. So promptly my friends go to the employers and fix the problem, we go back to the same branch and again one of the employers tells us that there's a problem and again we need to fix the letter, we took 3 times before we would even get their attention properly and they would finally explain to us all things which must be done correctly. I hope this review will be seen by someone in BANK_NAME that will be able to take the right disciplinary actions against the employers in that branch and perhaps replace them with someone who really cares about customers, but of course from now on I will not recommend anyone this bank an I will advise friends and relatives to do not keep an account in BANK_NAME. "
Customer_1779," If only it were possible to give minus stars.  Appalling bank, more like customer disservice! "," UK banks have a bad reputation for customer service, so you have to have low expectations, but no matter how low your expectations, BANK_NAME can still shock you with just how low they can go.Outsourcing call centres to India is one thing, making you wait 40 minutes, to speak to somebody in Mumbai, who doesn't speak English properly, and has no ability whatsoever to resolve your issue, who then puts you through to the wrong department in the UK, for which you wait another half an hour, is just the beginning.Trying to resolve anything over the phone with BANK_NAME is pretty much pointless.  But they give no e-mail address to deal with anything in writing either.  I can't remember if BANK_NAME was bailed out with taxpayers money, if it was, I want my money back, it should be closed down, it is not fit for any purpose, except for tormenting it's poor customers. "
Customer_1780, Terrible service ," Unhelpful bank manager and people on the phone who have no idea what they are doing. I only wanted to open an account for my 11 yr old, after wasting my day the bank manager decided I could do it online.....  I couldn't though. Thank god for BANK_NAME "
Customer_1781, Gone downhill ," Used to love BANK_NAME, even worked for them a few years ago. Also have a long line of family members who have worked for them, including my grandpa who was a bank manager for them for 50 years. Ever since they split with TSB they seem to have got worse and worse. Went into my local branch to change my name - simple procedure with all the right ID and paperwork and a month later it still hasn't been changed. This means my name on my bank card no longer matches any of the rest of my ID, causing me endless problems. I've had to phone customer services at least 4 times, every time they say they can't get through to the branch because no one answers the phone, regardless of the time of day. All they can do is 'request that someone calls you back' which would be fine, except nobody does! And why do I want them to call me back anyway, i've given them all my paperwork, it's their mistake and nothing to do with me! This should be resolved without my input, especially as I am 6 months pregnant and can't be travelling backwards and forewards to the branch all the time. At this point i'll be changing to a different bank, as will my husband who has also banked with them for years and we have our mortgage and house insurance with them. Will also be telling all my family and friends of the terrible service i've received. "
Customer_1782, Awful service , Very bad service and as I demand to speak to a manager the girl refused my request and kept raising her voice. 
Customer_1783, Agree rubbish ," Very greedy policy they have. I agree with the reviews above that they are horrible, although I experienced some very minor issue with them. I am going to close my account as soon as I can and choose a better bank. I'll make sure I spread the words. "
Customer_1784, Very helpful if a mistake is made rectified immediately , Very helpful if a mistake is made we all human it's rectified as soon as you complain only had complaint once in ten yrs. Very friendly staff in Diss nothing to much trouble. Compared to other banks I rate them five star best bank I ever been with and I will be with them now through retirement recommend. 
Customer_1785, Terrible Service. ," Visited Southampton Above Bar today , the sevice was terrible, only 1 teller on the tills, nobody queue combing. When a 2nd teller did appear she obviously did not want to be there and took as long as she could to make her self available. When she finally decided to serve there was no good morning, use of name, or thank you.  Wait time was at least 20 minutes. At least 3 people walked out, if I wanted to switch banks, that's one crossed off my list. "
Customer_1786, Don't waste time ," Was let down by this company, time wasted selecting and ordering items, week later to find out it was out of stock? "
Customer_1787, Was scammed by an online clothing , Was scammed by an online clothing scammer. Called Lloyd’s on several occasions they said they’d get back to me 24 hours later they did nothing had to call back again and the issue was not resolved lost a lot of money. Then I got really annoyed and called 6 times in the space of an hour they kept hanging up or disconnecting the line finally one guy tries to help but he was no use at all giving me information from a different case I finally told him to give me a response to why I was not got back to and so on and he terminated the call useless bank will be switching soon 
Customer_1788, Extremely poor and inefficient service ," We have been trying to setup an account with BANK_NAME for more than a month now and still haven't managed to do so. Apart from the 3 weeks delay to open our account due to them not reading carefully the forms we submitted and insisting that there were missing information (which was not the case), we haven't been able to setup our online banking as they messed up with the application forms. To their credit, the people at the customer service tried to be very helpful and polite and kept on apologising every time we called and said that the problem is now sorted. However, we haven't received anything from them and still don't have an online banking service about two months since we first applied.Unfortunately this is not good enough, as we are a business and needed the banking services up and running as quickly as possible.Very disappointing, BANK_NAME need to have their system rearranged as it doesn't really work as it is. "
Customer_1789, FAIL FAIL FAIL !!! , Went into this supposedly internationally well know bank to do two things….. we asked to draw out some cash from our Australian ANZ bank account.  After asking and producing a photo driver’s licence as identification – we were summarily dismissed and asked for Passports – which were locked away in safe in the hotel – we were then refused any cash by the teller – and told to use the ATM outside.    We then wanted to trade in a couple of “old” five pound notes – but were told that we could not do this as we had NO account there --- duhhhhhhh --- we were from Australia!    So thanks for nothing BANK_NAME- we will not deal with you again – our British friends and family who (currently anyway) have accounts with you were shocked and disappointed to hear how we were treated. 
Customer_1790, What a great response during , What a great response during  recent fraudulent activity on my account. Dealt with so professionally and with ease during a very stressful time . All transactions refunded within two minutes. Well done BANK_NAME I will continue my 25 years with you. 
Customer_1791, 4 months into a 4 week process.... ," What a joke. A minor admin task on my mortgage. 4 weeks to complete in the terms I signed. Well.... Debacle begins. Lots of lost paperwork (God knows how many copies of things were provided to this incompetent set up)...  No status updates, no response to communications, audacity to try charging me a late fee when the actions are on them (probably as I cannot get any answer) complainta process that doesn't respond, no.escaluation route for cases, cases managed by email, branches (if you can find one open when you might be free to use it) very unhelpful and rude. Online support have no ability to do anything other than trow platitudes at youAvoid and go to any other provider even a bloody crook that you know is one, rather than this lot. "
Customer_1792, What a rubbish bank , What a rubbish bank. They closed my account with them and money I have in my account  with them they will not give me my money back. Don't ever bank with BANK_NAME it's the worst bank ever. Made a complaint against the bank to get my money back from them 
Customer_1793, Poorest service I've ever had to encounter! ," What an absolute shambles!!!! Never have I had so many problems with one company! And no matter how many times you bring to their attention about how poor their service is, it continues to plummet!! I have SUFFERED countless phone calls after phone calls about being over promised, being told something would happen not once, twice but on the third time of chasing them on more than one occasion about a matter on my account which was not then addressed, money was taken from my account when it shouldn't have, they reduced my ISA interest rate without telling me, NEVER update their systems or notes and the worst of it..... The staff!!! They are either employing monkeys, which I feel is a detriment to the staff in itself as they all come across ever so nicely, or they have no idea about company structure, procedures and TRAINING!! Never have I been told so many things by the same organisation; I quote 'you can't reduce your overdraft through internet banking', to be told later that I can; 'we will change your address for you so that you can apply for utilities', and then they don't; 'you can't close an account over the phone it has to be in branch', yes in fact you can; 'I wasn't told that I wouldn't be protected on insurances whilst I have to wait for them to refresh', to be told 'well I'm telling you now' when it's too little too late! The list is endless but in my frustration I can't think of them all. Over the past year it has been nothing but agro, and after they palm me off from making a formal complaint with£75 this bull is still happening! Never have I ever dealt with such an unprofessional company! And I've been with them for 15 years! Maybe all of the policies and trained staff followed TSB?? "
Customer_1794, Car accident 1500 damage / no hire car as promised ," What an uttely shamefully disgusting company BANK_NAME are to deal with. Had a minor accident with £1500 of damage. Took 4 weeks to inspect it andcthen never carried it through or paid my repair work. 2 months with no car and ended having to pay it out my own pocket. £123 ringing there call centres, my solicitor rang there head office and no mtter how many times they said there litigation department would call him back they lie.BANK_NAME have never the less recorded my iccident and not paid me one penny back but increased my premium instead . I have rang and rang week after week only to be ignored promising call backs and were are resolving etc. Well BANK_NAME see you in court. Court papers submitted today after 8 months of giving you every chance in the world. Rude staff beyond belief. Legal fees alone and costs come to more than my repair. I hope you learn the hard way BANK_NAME car insurance.yuor a truly disgusting company . You pass it off to axa insurance and take zero responsibility when it goes wrong. Well my contract states  BANK_NAME car ins are my contractor. It is not my problem u sold it on to the 3rd party insurers who are impossible to contact.  60 hours of my time at £22 an hour will be also be claimed via the court hearing. All i have done is lose money in the process and give up my time ringing. Digracefully negligent supplier with the worst customer innit attitude""of staff ive ever dealt with. Shamefull insurer and pne i will be leaving. """
Customer_1795, BANK_NAME Click Safe drive you nuts after blocking payments ," Whereas I think BANK_NAME is a great bank, the Click Safe online payment method can drive you crazy. It blocks payments from reputable companies like airlines (Garuda Indonesia as an example), and leave you with no choice but calling them. First of all they don't have enough staff so you stay on hold for more than thirty minutes, while your phone bill keeps increasing, so yeah an additional ten quid on top of your plane ticket.They are supposed to call you back but I'm on the go and thus changing my phone number across countries so that's not an option for me. It would be much better a confirmation email.Just spent a few hours and some extra pounds to buy a simple airplane ticket. "
Customer_1796, While ill I had some money transferred … ," While ill I had some money transferred to my sisters account in case anything happened to me.  When I needed the money back BANK_NAME refused to transfer it back and accusing my sister of fraud and money laundering and putting her into a deep depression.  They knew the history of the money, where it had originated and where it went and that it was going back to the origin but no joyThe business Bank"" cost me a months trading and offered me a £250 compensationI think I would rather keep my money under my pillow from now on """
Customer_1797, BANK_NAME go out of their way to keep you in debt. ," Why is it that a customer of BANK_NAME Bank is able to extend their overdraft via a 30 second online form, but in order to reduce their overdraft it takes upwards of 30 minute phonecall or a visit to branch (not possible for the vast majority of working people)?The answer is obvious (they don't want people to claw their way out of debt due to the profit made on overdraft arrangements) but the entire process is so thoroughly morally bankrupt (thankyou, I'm here all week) it boggles my mind. I just want to pay my over draft off. I don't want to owe you money anymore. Happy to keep putting money in my account, but want it to be real money! Stop being such utter B******S! Especially when we bailed you out when you squandered all our money on subprime lending in the first place. There's only so much salt available to rub in the wound.It should be harder to get credit than to pay it off. "
Customer_1798, Immoral abuse of disabled person ," With FIVE THOUSAND AND EIGHTY-SIX OFFICAL complaints to ombudsman in just six months, how many actual complaints does BANK_NAME Bank PLC get?I have irrefutable evidence of deliberate and systematic abuse of a disabled person by staff at Hanover Street Edinburgh over a concentrated period.They admitted loads of mis-selling and refunded all premiums and gave compensation but, when it came to unauthorised overdrafts and three huge loans, they say this person with learning difficulties knew what he was signing.I have held three demonstrations outside th bank and am going to be forced to be there EVERY DAY.Further, BBC, STV and the press may be informed soon to blow this immoral company out of the water.You are messing with the wrong wrinkly BANK_NAME/TSB!Check out The People against BANK_NAME/TSB on FB.

Customer_1799, very unhappy and stressout , without any valid reason they close down my bank account.  when i asked staff member what was the reason behind my account close they did't give me clear reason just told me they check my review and were not happy that was not valid and proper reason. I have been loyal customer for 8 years and i have never done overdraft and there were enough money and now that what they gave me even the branch staff was not helpful and rude.   That make me feeling really unhappy and stress out.
